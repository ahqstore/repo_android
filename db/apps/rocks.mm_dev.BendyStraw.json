Android 13 introduced changes to make doing what I decribed above difficult. I explored alternative methods requiring fewer permissions and felt that it compromised the user experience for my (as the app's first user) typical usage, making it more complicated and annoying. I treat users as responsible human beings, so give you this info to allow you to make an informed choice. If you are not happy with this, you can:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Choose not to grant the permission, and uninstall the app.</li>\n  <li>Check the source code to see that I'm not doing anything nefarious, or ask somebody to check it for you (at time ","repo":{"author":"mm-dev","repo":"https://codeberg.org/mm-dev/bendy-straw"},"usrVersion":"87e2e2d643b04bab7020ec3ebb316e728c0dbc3c748e746cd16864d643f2e626","version":1768606935,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/mm-dev/bendy-straw","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
