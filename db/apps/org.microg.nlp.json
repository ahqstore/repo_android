On\nthese systems UnifiedNlp can be installed as a user app to replace the network\nlocation provider. It acts as a middleware for various plugins aka backends, it\ndoes not provide any location lookup itself. For further information please\nrefer to the https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.android.gms package and the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp/blob/HEAD/README.md\">README</a>.\n\nTo be able to use this package, you will either need the\n<a href=\"https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.r3w6.xposedunifiednlp\">XposedUnifiedNlp\nmodule</a>, or your custom ROM must have org.microg.nlp added to the list of\nnetwork location services, otherwise https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.android.gms would be more\nsuitable for you (provided that you do not have GAPPS installed on your system).\n\nAfter installing you have to reboot your device, install a backend service and\nactivate/configure it in the app settings. After this you can use UnifiedNlp by\nactivating network-based geolocation from Settings -> Location: You need to\nselect any mode but \"device only\".","repo":{"author":"microG Project","repo":"https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp"},"version":"bc2f3cf2cc7ed96ea598e7625c6a1227a28497348c8572209e98835a54fcdc06","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,109,105,99,114,111,103,46,110,108,112,46,50,48,49,56,55,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
