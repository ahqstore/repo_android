Just launch this app and talk. No need to click any\nother button. It tries to detect when you stop talking (provided you're not in\nan a noisy environment or far from the phone) and it records up to 45 seconds by\ndefault so it won't fill your memory card.\n\nWant to record another one? Touch the red dot, or launch it again from the phone\nlockscreen.\n\nThis app is for recording short notes, such as \"Remember to buy milk\". If you\nwant to record a long speech, don't use this app, but rather use VirtualRecorder\nfor example.\n\nNo network connection needed: notes are stored on the SD card. You can listen to\nnotes later: press the \"Menu\" key in Android 2, or click on \"Listen\" in Android\n4 action bar. Then click on a note.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://github.com/herverenault/DirectDictaphone/directory/"},"version":"a365ab4367283ed409e62503c4c1f40c49385d58625c89ea61f3188fc1e90cfe","site":null,"source":"https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/https://github.com/herverenault/DirectDictaphone/directory/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,102,114,46,104,101,114,118,101,114,101,110,97,117,108,116,46,100,105,114,101,99,116,100,105,99,116,97,112,104,111,110,101,46,49,57,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
