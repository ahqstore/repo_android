Exploration will be rewarded, and secrets await you!\n\nSo jump and run around, and enjoy losing your sense of orientation in this World of Wicked Weirdness. Find out what Van Vlijmen will make you do. Pick a path, get inside a Klein Bottle, recognize some memes, and by all means: don't look up.\n\nAnd beware of a minor amount of trolling.\n\nTo reach the end, a new player will take about 4 to 6 hours, a full playthrough can be finished in about 1 hour and the end can be reached in about 15 minutes.\n\nThis game is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
