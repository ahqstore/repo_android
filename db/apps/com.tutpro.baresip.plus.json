Voice can be codec with Opus, AMR, Codec2, G.729, G.726, G.722, G.722.1, and PCMU/PCMA, codecs. Video can be coded with VP9, VP8, H.265, H.264, and AV1 codecs. Security is achieved via TLS or WSS signalling transport and ZRTP or (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.\n\nMotivated by need for a secure SIP user agent for Android that does not depend on third party push notification services.\n\nThis application can be installed on Android devices running Android version 7.0 or later.  Video calling requires that Android device supports Camera 2 API at hardware support level LEVEL_3. If you don't need video calling, you can instead of this application install its sister application baresip.\n\nSource code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio\">GitHub</a>, where also issues can be reported.\n","repo":{"author":"Juha Heinanen","repo":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio"},"version":"de45d03392541524565a9fa6bc13bda434d1c6f1952b3a99308de81878cd1c96","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,116,117,116,112,114,111,46,98,97,114,101,115,105,112,46,112,108,117,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,118,66,117,101,118,119,120,45,88,73,107,111,98,65,120,89,67,67,87,97,54,122,45,110,118,98,110,50,97,70,78,67,65,67,56,80,82,75,72,84,118,110,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
