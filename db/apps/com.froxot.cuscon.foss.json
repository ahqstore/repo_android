Without a background, each icon stands out and breaks up the regular grid pattern. All the icons have a black border, enabling them to fit most backgrounds. The colour palette is retained and integrated into each icon. This makes the icons easy to recognise. Cuscon also ensures the icons are all the same size. All icons have the same spacing, resulting in a consistent size that does not require masking. Unlike many other icon packs, Cuscon supports the creation of icons for games and other complex designs. Therefore, it is possible to apply Cuscon in its entirety without any unedited icons that do not fit the theme. As Cuscon is open source, anyone can contribute icons and other changes on GitHub. Cuscon is compatible with most launchers, including Apex, Nova, Smart, Kiss, Lawnchair and others. You can request icons that have not yet been added to the application. Most calendars can be updated based on the date if the correct launcher is used.\n\nhttp://yazazuyo.froxot.com/cuscon/privacy-policy.html","repo":{"author":"MiepHD","repo":"https://github.com/MiepHD/cuscon"},"usrVersion":"d3971fa03799cbf11e9a4bd9c5c592e35200f0a1fcf0c678d767c50cd13dfb04","version":1761769303,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/MiepHD/cuscon","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
