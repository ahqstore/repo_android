It\nwas formerly known as Farebot M.\n\nThis is a fork of Eric Butler's Farebot project, with support for additional\ncards and bug fixes.\n\nSupported cards:\n\n* Bilhete Único - São Paulo, Brazil (1) (2) (5)\n* Clipper - San Francisco, CA, USA\n* EZ-Link - Singapore (3)\n* Go card - Brisbane and South East Queensland, Australia (0) (1) (2)\n* Manly Fast Ferry - Sydney (and surrounds), NSW, Australia (0) (1) (2)\n* Matkakortti, HSL - Finland\n* Myki - Melbourne (and surrounds), VIC, Australia (0) (4)\n* MyWay - Australian Capital Territory, Australia (0) (1) (2) (5)\n* NETS Flashpay - Singapore\n* Octopus - Hong Kong (0)\n* Opal - Sydney, NSW, Australia (0)\n* ORCA - Seattle, WA, USA\n* OV-chipkaart - Netherlands (1) (2)\n* Shenzhen Tong - Shenzong, Guangdong Province, China (0)\n* SmartRider - Western Australia, Australia (0) (1) (2)\n* Suica, IOCOA, PASMO, Edy - Japan\n* Transit Access Pass - Los Angeles, CA, USA (0) (1) (2)\n\n(0): New in Metrodroid.\n\n(1): Not compatible with all devices (Mifare Classic).\n\n(2): Encryption keys are required to read this card.\n\n(3): Not compatible with all devices (CEPAS).\n\n(4): Only the card number can be read.\n\n(5): Fallback reader -- must be explicitly enabled in the application's\npreferences.\n\nYou require a NFC-compatible phone in order to read cards.\n\nYou need a NXP NFC chipset in your phone in order to read MIFARE Classic cards.\nSome phones have NFC chips from other manufacturers, which do not read Mifare\nClassic cards (eg: Nexus 4, Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy S4). Check the About screen\nin the app in order to determine if your phone supports MIFARE Classic.\n\nSome agencies have encrypted cards. You will need to acquire encryption keys in\norder to read them. These are generally unique to each card. Sorry, I can't help\nyou with this.\n\nSome other agencies' cards using Cubic Nextfare on Mifare Classic may also work.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/metrodroid/metrodroid"},"version":"5139dd6b3c57c6722361c8177bcb431073beb70c7c9337be0503a49cf5f02203","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/metrodroid/metrodroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,97,117,46,105,100,46,109,105,99,111,108,111,117,115,46,102,97,114,101,98,111,116,46,51,57,50,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
