Just scan the barcode of an album and it will search MusicBrainz for matching releases and loads them into Picard on your desktop computer.\n\nThis is especially useful if you have your physical music collection already digitized and want to tag the files using exactly the album you own.\n\nPlease note: This is not a music file tagger for Android but rather a helper tool for MusicBrainz Picard on your desktop.\n\nRequirements:\n• Picard 1.0 or later\n• Your Android device and the computer running Picard should be both on the same network, and the port 8000 should be accessible\n\nThis app is free software published under the GPLv3. The source code is available on GitHub.\n\nYou can help translate this app into your language.
