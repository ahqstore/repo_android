Some of the following features are\nnot supported yet.\n\nText messages are not only end-to-end encrypted, they also get stored on your\ndevice in an encrypted way. Images, attachments etc. can be sent -- encrypted,\nof course, but since they depend on third-party programs, they are stored\nunencrypted. Dib2Qm makes use of your device's 'Download' folder (also for\nbackups and archives).\n\nYou need an e-mail account (on a server with standard IMAP and SMTP services),\nfor which a small app like this one is allowed to access the services.\n\nJust try it out! -- on a non-critical device (And if your e-mail provider blocks\nit, use a different provider. Dib2Qm does not depend on a centralized server.)\n\n- You can only chat with people who also use Dib2Qm.\n- After the setup, please first start the messaging service (via menu).\n- If you get a connection, the status should turn green (... 'ON').\n- Add a contact, via menu: you have to enter the other one's e-mail address.\n- If you then touch the new contact, you will be asked to send the 'invitation'\n(i.e. the key info for exchanging secured messages).\n- Once the key exchange is completely done (black/red, orange, green), the chat\nworks similar to other apps.\n\nIf one of your chats gets 'stuck' (due to a key exchange problem), just send\nanother 'invitation' from within the chat.\n\nIt is possible to use the address of your device's 'Google account', but they\ninsist on you explicitly allowing messenger apps: you would log in with your\nbrowser (!), go to 'Settings', 'Forwarding...IMAP', 'Enable IMAP', 'Save', then\nto 'Accounts', 'Other ... settings', '...Security', '2-Step...', 'Off', and\n'Connected apps', 'Allow less secure', 'On'.\n\nStrange? It is easier to use an extra e-mail account for Dib2Qm, but depending\non your provider you might still have to allow IMAP services. Both, using the\ndevice's account address or using a dedicated e-mail address for Dib2Qm, have\ntheir advantages and disadvantages ...\n\nIf you want to do a complete re-start, go to the device's settings, clear the\napp data, then open a file manager, clear the 'Download/dibdib' data, and then\nyou can start the app a-fresh.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/gxworks/Dib2Qm/tree/HEAD"},"version":"8ace1ef4718b4986350a969e3a9008c01ac70e8cf2ad18f5d28654afc892c4c4","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/gxworks/Dib2Qm/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,110,101,116,46,115,111,117,114,99,101,102,111,114,103,101,46,100,105,98,100,105,98,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,100,105,98,50,113,109,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,75,73,107,52,74,114,51,45,72,69,65,90,100,95,113,70,109,105,52,105,105,106,48,56,51,66,66,87,119,48,87,78,74,116,65,77,104,111,72,122,72,73,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
