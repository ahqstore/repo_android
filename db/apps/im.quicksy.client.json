Likewise users on Quicksy can be contacted from the outside simply by adding +phonenumber@quicksy.im to your contact list.\n\nAside from the contact sync the user interface is deliberately as close to Conversations as possible. This allows users to eventually migrate from Quicksy to Conversations without having to relearn how the app works.\n\nSuggested contacts consists of other Quicksy users and regular Jabber/XMPP users who have entered their Jabber ID into the Quicksy Directory (https://quicksy.im/#get-listed).\n\nNOTE: To enter (https://quicksy.im/enter/) your Jabber ID in the Quicksy\nDirectory an one time registration fee is required.\n\nRead the Privacy Policy (https://quicksy.im/#privacy) for more info.\n","repo":{"author":"Daniel Gultsch","repo":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations"},"version":"eeaa71c5b13e792168d6abe85316676649d56f6df5e8d96e5fdb3298e33a8a4d","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/iNPUTmice/Conversations","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
