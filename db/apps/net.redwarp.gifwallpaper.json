Probably the easiest way to use a GIF file as a live wallpaper.\n\nAll this is done in a few simple steps:\n\nStep 1 - Open the app \nStep 2 - Activate it.\nStep 3 - Click \"Open GIF\".\nStep 4 - Select the file you want.\n\nIf everything fits, that's it! Enjoy your new wallpaper!\n\nThe application stands out: \n- No need for root rights, small file size (<3MB)\n- Stops automatically when the wallpaper is not visible or the device is locked, thereby not consuming battery power.\n- And of course, no ads, and will not share your data or gather informations!\n\nSource available on https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper\n\nInterested in using it in your own language? Contact me if you would like to help with the translations!\n\nFAQ:\nQ: Can I set a different GIF for the home screen and the lock screen?\nA: Sorry, it's not possible: this is one of the limitation of Live Wallpapers, you can only apply to both. On some phones, they don't even run on lock screens!\n","repo":{"author":"Benoit Vermont","repo":"https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper"},"version":"3f923547f91f9559227d40eb7f6e59223ba05ba80d9d1e7c870801e3a7dddffa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/redwarp/gif-wallpaper","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,110,101,116,46,114,101,100,119,97,114,112,46,103,105,102,119,97,108,108,112,97,112,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,68,51,81,111,82,116,78,98,112,110,103,79,77,85,113,77,53,69,53,54,79,87,100,88,97,98,88,106,65,105,77,51,53,111,109,55,81,121,95,52,53,65,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
