Remap volume, power, keyboard, or floating buttons!\nMake custom macros on your keyboard or gamepad, make on-screen buttons in any app, and unlock new functionality from your volume buttons!\n\nKey Mapper supports a huge variety of buttons and keys*:\n\n- ALL your phone buttons (volume AND side key)\n- Game controllers (D-pad, ABXY, and most others)\n- Keyboards\n- Headsets and headphones\n- Fingerprint sensor\n\nNot enough keys? Design your own on-screen button layouts and remap those just like real keys!\n\n\nWhat shortcuts can I make?\n--------------------------\n\nWith over 100 individual actions, the sky is the limit.\nBuild complex macros with screen taps and gestures, keyboard inputs, open apps, control media, and even send intents directly to other apps.\n\n\nHow much control do I have?\n---------------------------\n\nTRIGGERS: You decide how to trigger a key map. Long press, double press, press as many times as you like! Combine keys on different devices, and even include your on-screen buttons.\n\nACTIONS: Design specific macros for what you want to do. Combine over 100 actions, and choose the delay between each one. Set repeating actions to automate and speed up slow tasks.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: You choose when key maps should run and when they shouldn't. Only need it in one specific app? Or when media is playing? On your lockscreen? Constrain your key maps for maximum control.\n\n* Most devices are already supported, with new devices being added over time. Let us know if it's not working for you and we can prioritize your device.\n\nNot currently supported:\n - Mouse buttons\n - Joysticks and triggers (LT,RT) on gamepads\n\n\nSecurity and accessibility services\n---------------------------\n\nThis app includes our Key Mapper Accessibility service that uses the Android Accessibility API to detect the app in focus and adapt key presses to user-defined key maps. It is also used to draw assistive Floating Button overlays on top of other apps.\n\nBy accepting to run the accessibility service, the app will monitor key strokes while you're using your device. It will also emulate swipes and pinches if you are using those actions in the app.\n\nIt will NOT collect any user data or connect to the internet to send any data anywhere.\n\nOur accessibility service is only triggered by the user when pressing a physical key on their device. It can be turned off any time by the user in the system accessibility settings.\n\nCome say hi in our Discord community!\nwww.keymapper.club\n\nSee the code for yourself!
