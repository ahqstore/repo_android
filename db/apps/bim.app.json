The players can drop bombs to destroy the walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the bombs' blast distance.\n\nThe match features can be selected from the matchmaking screen. Features enabled by all participants will be used in the game, allowing players to customize their contest.\n","repo":{"author":"Julien Jorge","repo":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/"},"version":"ec68e335725a3337bc5fe6808cef8184c43e176bcc9b40b478e791a3297c423d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
