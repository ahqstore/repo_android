The players can drop bombs to destroy the walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the bombs' blast distance.\n\nAs you'll progress in the game you'll unlock additional gameplay features to spice the competition up. Select your favorite game features and see them combining with the selection from your opponents. There's no pay to win here, all features will impact every player in a match equally, so pick your ingredients wisely!\n","repo":{"author":"Julien Jorge","repo":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/"},"usrVersion":"9c694d96ce629be1c845f00ca6be24d0a34f8ca4518344c6e4551dd4cb3564f0","version":1769341219,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
