The players can drop bombs to destroy the walls or, ultimately, attack another player. Sometimes the broken walls will expose a bonus such as extra bombs or an increase of the bombs' blast distance.\n\nThe match's features can be selected from the matchmaking screen. It is enough of one player enabling a feature for all players benefiting from it during the contest.\n","repo":{"author":"Julien Jorge","repo":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/"},"version":"db4b8b36c5ae17db6607b5dfb645caacb35af804c7f60b5488c084d265a6679a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/j-jorge/bim/","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
