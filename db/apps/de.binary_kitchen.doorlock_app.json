If activated, newer Android versions (Oreo and upwards) require coarse grained location permissions. Otherwise SSID can not be read.\n* Settings screen won't disappear unless user provided username & password\n* The app contains a widget -- the space widget. It remotely shows if the space is open. A click on the button will update it.\n* Please file bug reports on https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/doorlock-app\n\nGood quality... No fake! Contains 50 metric tons of finest software engineering.\n.\"\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/binary-kitchen/doorlock-app"},"version":"f54e2e627b047e2281337fb12561b2ee10d8d55b5bcf92aecdaaa5663723df9c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/binary-kitchen/doorlock-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,98,105,110,97,114,121,95,107,105,116,99,104,101,110,46,100,111,111,114,108,111,99,107,95,97,112,112,46,56,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
