If activated, newer Android versions (Oreo and upwards) require coarse grained location permissions. Otherwise SSID can not be read.\n* Settings screen won't disappear unless user provided username & password\n* The app contains a widget -- the space widget. It remotely shows if the space is open. A click on the button will update it.\n* Please file bug reports on https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/doorlock-app\n\nGood quality... No fake! Contains 50 metric tons of finest software engineering.\n.\"\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/binary-kitchen/doorlock-app"},"usrVersion":"f54e2e627b047e2281337fb12561b2ee10d8d55b5bcf92aecdaaa5663723df9c","version":1760237258,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/binary-kitchen/doorlock-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
