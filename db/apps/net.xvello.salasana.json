If one of\nthem is hacked or malevolent, you risk exposing your other accounts.\n\nIt mixes together your personal master password and the website domain using\na little cryptographic magic we call SHA-1. It will always get the same result\nif given that domain name and master password, but will never get that result\nif either changes. (Well, once in a few billion times it might.)\n","repo":{"author":"Xavier Vello","repo":"https://github.com/xvello/salasana-android"},"version":"5d18f53c29b6e4fd5471c54681d52b62fca1cfc687a081e04ac005bafeb56eec","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/xvello/salasana-android","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
