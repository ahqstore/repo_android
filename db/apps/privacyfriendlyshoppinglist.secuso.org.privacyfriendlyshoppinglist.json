Minimal Permissions\nPrivacy Friendly Shopping List does not use any permission for its core functions. Only the camera permission is needed, so you can take a picture for a particular product. If this permission is denied (Android version higher than 6), the feature will not be available. All other features will be at your disposition.\n\n2. Full control over your data\nAll saved data in the statistics can be deleted permanently with just a few clicks. All this data lives only inside Privacy Friendly Shopping List and can not be accessed from outside.\n\n3. Sharing of list or product data without access of the phone contacts.\n\n4. No advertisement\nPrivacy Friendly Shopping List completely relinquishes advertisement.\n\n\nFeel free to contact us via:\nBluesky - @secusoresearch.bsky.social https://bsky.app/profile/secusoresearch.bsky.social\nMastodon - @SECUSO_Research@bawü.social https://xn--baw-joa.social/@SECUSO_Research/\nJob opening - https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/english/Job_Offers.php","repo":{"author":"SECUSO","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-shopping-list"},"usrVersion":"78b4c6b91c30c0b4974ecf5105b10688f256c62e9f1fe4196e614bc980790875","version":1761520628,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-shopping-list","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
