Works entirely offline:\n- You enter a list of stores.\n- You enter a list of products sold at those stores.\n- You enter, update and confirm the prices of those products at those stores as you shop.\n- The app shows you the unit price of a product at all the stores which sell it, allowing you to decide where to buy it.\n\nThe user interface is designed for minimal fuss when you're standing in the supermarket aisle with a basket in one hand and your phone in the other.\n\nUnit conversions are handled automatically with support for metric, imperial and US customary units.\n\nHow long ago a price was last updated is tracked automatically so you won't be misled by out-of-date prices.\n","repo":{"author":"ZornsLemma","repo":"https://github.com/ZornsLemma/my-price-log"},"usrVersion":"b65a09ba121ee45fd957444cbd59ce6b6eb52fa70334bdb073f4f8eb1c1546cf","version":1767922931,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ZornsLemma/my-price-log","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
