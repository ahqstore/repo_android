It works entirely offline:</p><ul><li>You enter a list of stores.</li><li>You enter a list of products sold at those stores.</li><li>You enter, update and confirm the prices of those products at those stores as you shop.</li><li>The app shows you the unit price of a product at all the stores which sell it, allowing you to decide where to buy it.</li></ul><p>There’s nothing particularly fancy or clever here. It’s a very simple, specialised database with a user interface optimised for easy use when you’re standing in a supermarket aisle with a basket or trolley.</p><p>The app tracks how old each price is, so you won’t be misled by out-of-date prices. Old prices are indicated by icons and a simplistic inflation adjustment is applied to try to keep them somewhat useful, although for best results you should update the prices yourself. You can view a price’s history if you want to see how it has changed over time.</p><p>The app will make a recommendation as to whether a price is good, OK or bad if it has enough information. A list of unit prices is also shown so you can decide for yourself.</p><p>Customer loyalty scheme discounts can be specified for each store and these will be used to adjust the unit price when making a comparison between stores.</p><p>Unit conversions are handled automatically, both within and between measurement systems. Metric, imperial and US customary units are all supported.</p>","repo":{"author":"ZornsLemma","repo":"https://github.com/ZornsLemma/my-price-log"},"usrVersion":"b9d1943943f81b4a313e50201295a09cad636f71d8b27b650acb38bbc096d640","version":1769287396,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ZornsLemma/my-price-log","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
