Collectively, “WLAN/WiFi and\nmobile/cellular” signals will be called “RF emitters” below.\n\nConceptually, this backend consists of two parts sharing a common database. One\npart passively monitors the GPS. If the GPS has acquired and has a good position\naccuracy, then the coverage maps for RF emitters detected by the phone are\ncreated and saved.\n\nThe other part is the actual location provider which uses the database to\nestimate location when the GPS is not available.\n\nThis backend uses no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on the\nphone.","repo":{"author":"n76","repo":"https://github.com/n76/DejaVu"},"version":"1254b0b39b3446f934ec97a922923d3d135ce9c8f1243c6deb129379d50bb1c7","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/n76/DejaVu","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,102,105,116,99,104,102,97,109,105,108,121,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,100,101,106,97,118,117,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,116,67,69,119,98,51,77,106,50,112,82,85,71,119,45,87,108,101,103,117,88,74,54,101,95,66,56,74,68,49,78,76,122,109,121,101,80,82,122,83,49,78,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
