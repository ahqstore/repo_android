It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which looks like real words but are still very random and unpredictable.\n\nIt also comes with a clever two factor authentication to unlock the vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).\n\nYou can also access the vault from your laptop at home, if you use the <a href=\"https://anotherpass.jepfa.de/extension\">ANOTHERpass Browser Extension</a>.\n\n<b>Core features of the app</b>\n\n- easy two factor authentication\n- no complicated master password to memorize, it is just exported\n- easy to read generated passwords\n- strong modern encryption (AES 128/256, Blowfish, Chacha20)\n- uses an integrated security chip or TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) if present\n- Autofill support\n- works with the <a href=\"https://anotherpass.jepfa.de/extension\">ANOTHERpass Browser Extension</a> to share credentials within a local network (e.g. from the app to the desktop PC)\n- biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) to use stored master password\n- no insecure clipboard function by default\n- show passwords over other apps to type it easily\n- no data is stored in the cloud, except if the user itself backups files in the cloud\n- export and import credential vault\n- export vault and master key separately (latter analogue if wished)\n- share and outsource credentials\n- one-time-password support (HOTP and TOTP)\n- obfuscate several passwords as additional security layer\n- optional self destruction mode after too many failed login attempts\n- Dark theme support ;-)\n\nFor detailed information see <a href=\"https://anotherpass.jepfa.de\">anotherpass.jepfa.de</a>\n\nIf you like the app please star it on <a href=\"https://github.com/jenspfahl/ANOTHERpass\">Github</a>!\n","repo":{"author":"Jens Pfahl","repo":"https://github.com/jenspfahl/ANOTHERpass"},"version":"614efa8d3099ce8446d330d1a2333343ea6168ffaa837e784511fafcee65fecb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jenspfahl/ANOTHERpass","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,106,101,112,102,97,46,121,97,112,109,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,100,81,118,115,57,89,67,105,106,110,111,101,69,111,89,113,68,66,117,50,56,112,56,101,75,116,87,72,109,84,89,112,52,70,113,74,103,95,90,49,106,117,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
