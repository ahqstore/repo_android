If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.\n\nYou can link Briar with a device running Briar Mailbox (even on Android: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.briarproject.mailbox/) to receive encrypted messages from your contacts while Briar is offline.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar"},"version":"3eeddd867eb7dc97f3ea8beb46871bf4428f476ff91b001b19af347efdec7490","site":null,"source":"https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
