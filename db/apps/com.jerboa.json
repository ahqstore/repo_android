Behind the scenes, it is very different; anyone can easily run a server, and all these servers are federated (think email), and connected to the same universe, called the Fediverse.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/jerboa"},"version":"7158536c1ec3f5ebb7e0f33d9361199040e4cc0f0d8d117a0291793d9a3cb0a0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/jerboa","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,106,101,114,98,111,97,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,86,108,117,121,53,52,116,100,67,90,117,51,122,97,86,88,108,77,57,112,76,45,118,56,50,80,67,117,56,80,71,122,81,77,51,78,97,51,111,107,90,77,65,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
