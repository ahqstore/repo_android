(Contacts import and export are currently functional but considered experimental.) It does not require root.\n\nThe primary author of SMS Import / Export is Thomas More. Others have contributed code and translations. The software is copyright 2021-2024, and is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later.\n\nSMS Import / Export is a sibling project to <a href=\"https://github.com/tmo1/sms-db\">sms-db</a>, a Linux tool to build an SQLite database out of collections of SMS and MMS messages in various formats. sms-db will hopefully eventually be able to import ZIP files created by SMS Import / Export, and to export its database to ZIP files that can be imported by SMS Import / Export.\n","repo":{"author":"tmo1","repo":"https://github.com/tmo1/sms-ie"},"version":"ad19ad2422a5e8c736355d6be90d96a7cc9f0099c0ac81292f8d5a1fb75802ac","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tmo1/sms-ie","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
