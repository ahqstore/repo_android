SoundAura can also switch between an audio focus respecting mode, and a 'play in background' mode that ignores audio focus rules and allows SoundAura to play audio alongside other apps.","repo":{"author":"CliffracerMerchant","repo":"https://github.com/CliffracerMerchant/SoundAura"},"version":"cbbd83450006bcec6736b9e808c926ae2c0b3453f983d5c9dddcbf7c334e843f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/CliffracerMerchant/SoundAura","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,99,108,105,102,102,114,97,99,101,114,116,101,99,104,46,115,111,117,110,100,97,117,114,97,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,69,57,82,82,77,81,117,56,97,55,48,110,89,86,84,84,73,113,121,50,79,97,109,104,77,48,113,48,97,76,103,90,76,74,74,103,90,121,120,55,120,98,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
