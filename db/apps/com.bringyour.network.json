Join a decentralized VPN that advances the state of the art of privacy, availability, security, and performance.\n\nWith URnetwork you get:\n\n- Multiple IPs at once. When you connect, every dot represents a unique IP. The IPs continually change and traffic is distributed amongst IPs for best performance.\n\n- No more insecure protocols. Older insecure protocols are disabled and seamlessly upgraded to modern encrypted protocols.\n\n- Built-in anonymity. Hard guarantees of anonymity using a large decentralized multi-hop network.\n\n- Global availability. The network learns and adapts to give you connectivity no matter where you are in the world.\n\n- 100% open source and reproducible. See the exact code on the client and server. No logs, no spies.\n\nURnetwork uses VPNService to route your device traffic to provider devices. Traffic is encrypted using an open-source, web-standards protocol. Additionally traffic is anonymized using the URnetwork protocol.\n\nURnetwork links an external Solana wallet. We do not have custody of your wallet or facilitate swaps within the app.\n\n","repo":{"author":"URnetwork","repo":"https://github.com/urnetwork/android"},"version":"cbd1f7e917d8fc7c7deb38396ae678e886bd2111efe1c3843697b25a7ae95056","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/urnetwork/android","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
