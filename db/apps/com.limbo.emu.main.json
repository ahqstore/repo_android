To connect to an external VNC, you\ncan use https://f-droid.org/packages/com.coboltforge.dontmind.multivnc or https://f-droid.org/packages/android.androidVNC\nclients available in F-Droid.\n\nOn android devices with x86-based CPU (Intel Atom), Limbo can run with\nKVM mode, allowing for much better perfomance.\n\nKeep in mind, limbo is a complete emulation of another CPU architecture,\nso you most likely won't be able to run modern operating systems\nwith reasonable perfomance.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/limboemu/limbo"},"version":"b85ae2ed1963104b03e1e29581f4bccd4163818208dbcbcb427b5168b495efaf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/limboemu/limbo","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,108,105,109,98,111,46,101,109,117,46,109,97,105,110,46,54,48,48,48,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
