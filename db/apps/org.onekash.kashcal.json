No workaround needed.\n• CalDAV: Nextcloud, Radicale, Baïkal, Stalwart, FastMail, and more. Native sync, no middleware.\n• Holidays & schedules: Subscribe to any ICS calendar. Holidays, school schedules, sports seasons.\n• Birthdays: Pulls from your contacts automatically.\n• Local: Don't need sync? Works fully offline out of the box.\n\nMaterial You with dynamic theming. Home screen widgets. Full-text search across all events. Per-event timezone for travel.\n\nPrivate by default\n\nNo analytics. No telemetry. No KashCal account. Your data stays on your device unless you set up sync yourself.\n\n• Encrypted credentials (AES-256-GCM)\n• Fort Knox Mode: other apps can't read your events\n• HTTPS only, no WebViews, minimal permissions\n• Open source: fully auditable\n\nWebsite: https://kashcal.github.io\n\nSource code: https://github.com/KashCal/KashCal\n","repo":{"author":"KashCal","repo":"https://github.com/KashCal/KashCal"},"usrVersion":"591a421c8108ac7ad8d539435682e45f1ee25dfd9824184bab43184e60fdf01a","version":1771053019,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/KashCal/KashCal","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
