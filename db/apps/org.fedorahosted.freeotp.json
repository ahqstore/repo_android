Tokens can be added easily by scanning a\nQR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.\n\nFreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side\ncomponent is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these\nstandards - for example <a href=\"http://www.freeipa.org\">FreeIPA</a>, which uses TOTP. Any\nstandards-compliant implementation will work. Currently, FreeOTP provides\nimplementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/freeotp/freeotp-android"},"usrVersion":"48212d63dd3a3a8a8d6201b8d911f239efb1561f08472057b2c55a65ebb0a94f","version":1771677903,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/freeotp/freeotp-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
