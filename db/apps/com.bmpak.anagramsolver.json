One word anagrams (where a\nsingle word is anagrammed into another single word) are sometimes referred to by\nwordplay specialists as transpositions. For example, \"listen\" is a transposition\nof \"silent\".\n\nYou can type a regular or a scrambled word and see all the possible\ncombinations. Come up with a word and let the app find all the possible\nanagrams. Browsing through random anagrams is a fun option! You can also use the\napp as a spelling dictionary.\n\nLanguages:\n\n* English\n* Greek\n* French\n* German","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/charbgr/Anagram-Solver"},"version":"044f52c89a576d40a22087cd6a4bb9755326c4942e913106a325633185eb9cd5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/charbgr/Anagram-Solver","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,98,109,112,97,107,46,97,110,97,103,114,97,109,115,111,108,118,101,114,46,50,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
