Any app can get your copied password, credit card numbers, and more.\n\nAndroid has AutoFill or other mechanisms to handle sensitive info. Android Q also fixes this problem partly. But there are still some ways to bypass the limit, like using accessibility services and showing a transparent window.\n\nClipboardCleaner can't protect your passwords from being got by any app. But it gives you ways to check and clean your clipboard.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/DeweyReed/ClipboardCleaner"},"version":"abc1bf9d86c93b834c78865df5c65d6efc6da92d0588552a519682690b92f270","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/DeweyReed/ClipboardCleaner","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,111,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,100,101,119,101,121,114,101,101,100,46,99,108,105,112,98,111,97,114,100,99,108,101,97,110,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,72,98,104,76,122,111,86,100,68,85,84,66,70,98,69,120,70,78,100,49,104,106,97,86,120,111,118,90,87,87,71,75,111,51,103,57,115,73,98,118,79,68,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
