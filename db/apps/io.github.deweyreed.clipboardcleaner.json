Any app can get your copied password, credit card numbers, and more.\n\nAndroid has AutoFill or other mechanisms to handle sensitive info. Android Q also fixes this problem partly. But there are still some ways to bypass the limit, like using accessibility services and showing a transparent window.\n\nClipboardCleaner can't protect your passwords from being got by any app. But it gives you ways to check and clean your clipboard.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/DeweyReed/ClipboardCleaner"},"usrVersion":"abc1bf9d86c93b834c78865df5c65d6efc6da92d0588552a519682690b92f270","version":1761290335,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/DeweyReed/ClipboardCleaner","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
