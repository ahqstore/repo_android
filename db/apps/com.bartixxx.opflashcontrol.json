The app works on both rooted and non-rooted devices, offering different feature sets based on your device's capabilities.\n\nFor Rooted OnePlus Devices (Full Features):\nWith root access on OnePlus devices, the app provides complete control over your device's LED functionality, allowing you to customize individual white and yellow LED brightness levels beyond stock settings and access advanced features.\n\nFor Non-Rooted Devices (Android 13+):\nEven without root, the app offers basic flashlight control using Android's CameraManager API. While designed for OnePlus, this mode may also work on other Android 13+ devices as a bonus feature (not officially supported).\n\nKey Features:\n- Master Brightness Control: Adjust the overall LED brightness using a slider (0-500 on rooted devices, 1-5 torch levels on non-rooted).\n- Individual LED Control (Root Only): Independently control the brightness of white and yellow LEDs for precise customization.\n- Safety Mechanism: The app includes safety features that ensure brightness levels never exceed safe thresholds, automatically adjusting brightness to safe levels if necessary (rooted devices only).\n- \"Eye Destroyer\" Mode (Root Only): A unique feature that flashes the LEDs at maximum brightness, emitting very intense light. This function is protected by a cooldown to prevent excessive use.\n- Quick Settings Tile: A quick settings tile to toggle the LED brightness with ease, including cycling through brightness levels and detecting double-tap gestures.\n- Adaptive UI: The app automatically hides advanced controls on non-rooted devices, providing a clean and appropriate user experience.\n- Secret Action: Unlock hidden experimental features by tapping the app's title 5 times within 5 seconds.\n\nCompatibility:\n- OnePlus Devices (Rooted): Full feature access with system-level dual-LED control.\n- OnePlus Devices (Non-Rooted, Android 13+): Basic flashlight control with torch strength levels.\n- Other Android 13+ Devices (Non-Rooted): May work as a bonus feature, but not officially supported.\n- Whether you're looking to fine-tune your OnePlus device's LED functionality with root access or simply need reliable flashlight control without root, OnePlus Flash Control adapts to your device's capabilities.","repo":{"author":"Bartixxx","repo":"https://github.com/Bartixxx32/Opflashcontrol-app"},"usrVersion":"38cab387db7656e8b46c30464f31d00ae56fbe306d88cf3243462b11db9d093a","version":1769125424,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Bartixxx32/Opflashcontrol-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
