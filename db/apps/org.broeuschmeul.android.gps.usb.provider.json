I have a main controller which automatically starts this application's background service when my car starts.</p>\n<p>The application is designed to work with any SiRF USB GPS device, however it has been tested as working with GlobalSat BU-353-S4 and a device based on the UBLOX LEA-M8P chip.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/freshollie/UsbGps4Droid"},"version":"788c0d70799235c79fe575b766a88c724eb531d68a65c0d1562ee22cff3f6059","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/freshollie/UsbGps4Droid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,98,114,111,101,117,115,99,104,109,101,117,108,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,103,112,115,46,117,115,98,46,112,114,111,118,105,100,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,121,85,57,81,102,56,56,74,111,77,90,107,114,73,66,56,78,87,53,103,45,82,95,105,45,49,67,109,85,118,89,97,107,53,100,54,52,100,67,97,54,68,65,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
