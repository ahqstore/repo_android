Simply include OSM questions and tags in your\nsurvey to collect information on OSM in the field.\n\nTraditional field data collection tools for OpenStreetMap have either relied on\npaper or are too complicated, targeted at GIS professionals, or lack an\nunderstanding of traditional survey techniques.
