Simply include OSM questions and tags in your\nsurvey to collect information on OSM in the field.\n\nTraditional field data collection tools for OpenStreetMap have either relied on\npaper or are too complicated, targeted at GIS professionals, or lack an\nunderstanding of traditional survey techniques. As new projects such as\n<a href=\"http://www.missingmaps.org/\">Missing Maps</a> and other humanitarian field data\ncollection projects focus on field data collection the need for a structured,\nyet simple, OpenStreetMap field data collection tool became apparent. OpenMapKit\nserves this need.\n\n* View OpenStreetMap tiles via web and pre-cached mbtiles.\n* Download OSM data from the <a href=\"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API\">Overpass API</a> for offline use.\n* Create and update tags for OSM features.\n* Integration with <a href=\"https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/\">ODK Collect</a>.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/posm/OpenMapKitAndroid"},"version":"4ea9ca838db1fc0818895223c55f5e81e97ce3329d076de2167a64453b3c4c58","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/posm/OpenMapKitAndroid","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,114,101,100,99,114,111,115,115,46,111,112,101,110,109,97,112,107,105,116,46,50,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
