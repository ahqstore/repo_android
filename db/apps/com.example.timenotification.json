The information is always visible in an icon in the status bar and in a notification, even while you use other apps.\n\nPractical uses of monitoring battery voltage:\n\n    🔋 Check battery real health\n       Spot signs of battery degradation. Watch for sudden or irregular voltage drops—these are early signs that the battery is degrading.\n\n    🔌 Catch bad chargers or cables\n       During charging, voltage should rise smoothly (e.g., 3.7 V → 4.2 V). If it stays flat or jumps irregularly, the cable or adapter is likely defective.\n\n    💀 Avoid unexpected shutdowns\n       Monitoring voltage lets you see the exact point where the phone shuts down from low battery. Helping you avoid surprises like the device shutting down at 30% charge.\n\n    📈 Save money on unnecessary battery replacement\n       Monitor battery’s voltage to know its true health and decide a battery replacement only when it is actually needed.\n\n    ⚠️ Prolong battery lifespan\n       Batteries experience high stress when charged to their maximum voltage, which often happens before the charge indicator shows 100%. By monitoring voltage, you can unplug your phone at the optimal point to reduce stress and extend battery life.\n\n    🔎 Evaluate aftermarket replacement battery capacity\n       Quickly know a replacement battery’s quaity. A good battery holds stable voltage under load, while a poor-quality battery drops quickly under use and spikes sharply when charging.\n\n\nThe Battery Voltage Display app is a tool for anyone who wants detailed insights into their Android smartphone’s battery health. \n\n\nKey Features:\n\n    - User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring easy navigation and quick access to vital battery data.\n    - Automatic Startup Support: Enables continuous monitoring without requiring manual app relaunches after a reboot.\n    - Resource Efficiency: The app operates with minimal RAM usage, ensuring it does not interfere with system performance.\n    - No Hidden Processes: Unlike many background apps, it does not run covert services, preventing unnecessary battery drain.\n    - Manual Exit Functionality: Allows users to completely exit the app with a single button press, ensuring full control over system resources.\n    - Ad-Free Experience: The app is entirely free to use without any intrusive advertisements disrupting the user experience.\n    - Wide Compatibility: Works seamlessly on devices running Android 8 and newer versions.\n\nCreated by Eugen Barilyuk EB43 https://eb43.github.io","repo":{"author":"Eugen Barilyuk EB43","repo":"https://github.com/Eb43/bateryvoltagedisplay"},"usrVersion":"5f47ee3106bef896387da1fd988172460155052683a0503542ae7feca21bb6c3","version":1761252080,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Eb43/bateryvoltagedisplay","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
