Seamless. On Matrix\nFreedom to communicate on your own terms\n\nFor individuals and communities - private communication between family, friends, hobby groups, clubs, etc.\n\nElement X gives you fast, secure and private instant messaging and video calls built on Matrix, the open standard for real-time communication. This is a free and open-source app maintained at https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android.\n\nStay in touch with friends, family and communities with:\n • Real time messaging & video calls\n • Public rooms for open group communication\n • Private rooms for closed group communication\n • Rich messaging features: emoji reactions, replies, polls, pinned messages and more.\n • Video calling while browsing messages.\n • Interoperability with other Matrix-based apps such as FluffyChat, Cinny and many more.\n\n<b>Privacy-first<b>\nUnlike some other messengers from Big Tech companies, we don’t mine your data or monitor your communications.\n\n<b>Own your conversations</b>\nChoose where to host your data - from any public server (the largest free server is matrix.org, but there are plenty of others to choose from) to creating your own personal server and hosting it on your own domain. This ability to choose a server is a large part of what differentiates us from other real time communication apps. However you host, you have ownership; it’s your data. You’re not the product. You’re in control.\n\n<b>Communicate in real time, all the time</b>\nUse Element everywhere. Stay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronised message history across all your devices, including on the web at https://app.element.io\n\n<b>Element X is our next-generation app</b>\nIf you’re using the original Element app, it’s time to try Element X! It’s faster, easier to use, and more powerful than the original app. It’s better in every way and we’re adding new features all the time.\n\nThe application requires the android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission to enable the installation of applications received as attachments, ensuring seamless and convenient access to new software within the app.\n\nThe application requires the USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT permission to ensure our users can effectively receive call notifications even when their devices are locked.\n","repo":{"author":"SpiritCroc","repo":"https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next"},"version":"817452a088b12f6219ec4997206103008f70fd7df9a116a70cab73f1fd4ba75a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
