Apps2Org allows you to organize installed applications using\nlabels/tags/categories. You can associate labels to applications, browse thru\nlabeled categories and launch applications - either using the application or\nshortcut on your home screen.\n\nComparing to original application, following changes were made:\n\n* \"All labels\" shortcut now includes \"Other\" (uncategorized) apps, so this shortcut completely replaces app launcher and gives access to all of your apps.\n* You can easily star/set label for an app directly from shortcut widget, so you can keep your app collection organized \"right on the spot\" with very little effort.\n* Other minor fixes and improvements.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/pfalcon/apps2org"},"version":"9577ff3fb5641b76bd6cd9861820600571cefebb63448e17934fb71f92fac999","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pfalcon/apps2org","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
