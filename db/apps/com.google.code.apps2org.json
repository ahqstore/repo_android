Apps2Org allows you to organize installed applications using\nlabels/tags/categories. You can associate labels to applications, browse thru\nlabeled categories and launch applications - either using the application or\nshortcut on your home screen.\n\nComparing to original application, following changes were made:\n\n* \"All labels\" shortcut now includes \"Other\" (uncategorized) apps, so this shortcut completely replaces app launcher and gives access to all of your apps.\n* You can easily star/set label for an app directly from shortcut widget, so you can keep your app collection organized \"right on the spot\" with very little effort.\n* Other minor fixes and improvements.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/pfalcon/apps2org"},"version":"9577ff3fb5641b76bd6cd9861820600571cefebb63448e17934fb71f92fac999","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pfalcon/apps2org","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
