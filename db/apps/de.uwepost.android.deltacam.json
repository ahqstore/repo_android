For example running ants leave dark lines on a light surface, or driving cars make light lines on a dark surface. Make sure not to move the camera during recording. You can share images with other apps, adjust sensitivity and switch between light-on-dark and dark-on-light mode. You can create some amazing pictures for example with light painting. This is NOT just a long time exposure! The app uses the first captured frame as \"background\" and then records differences (deltas), either negative (dark on light) or positive (light on dark) to add them up. See homepage for some examples.","repo":{"author":"Uwe Post","repo":"https://github.com/upost/DeltaCamera"},"version":"5a29f3ffd68e3d4503982c1979365d4d7fa2a2380d59aa4239b4ef334a58d582","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/upost/DeltaCamera","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,117,119,101,112,111,115,116,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,100,101,108,116,97,99,97,109,46,49,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
