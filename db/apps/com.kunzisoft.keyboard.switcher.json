System-managed notifications also allow this change.\nIn these cases, the application may be superfluous.</i>\n\nKeyboard Switcher is <b>opensource</b> and <b>ad-free</b>, it survives thanks to your contributions and donations.\n\nAny issue : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues\">https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Kunzisoft","repo":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher"},"usrVersion":"7fcfbe6303d8e66e2dc1de946eebda8666e35603591a916942fa3b255d9879cb","version":1768274267,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
