System-managed notifications also allow this change.\nIn these cases, the application may be superfluous.</i>\n\nKeyboard Switcher is <b>opensource</b> and <b>ad-free</b>, it survives thanks to your contributions and donations.\n\nAny issue : <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues\">https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher/issues</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Kunzisoft","repo":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher"},"usrVersion":"d7a68d080965ffe517c4a33ccb13f14ecce8e80c80b2d76d972cc07cf7f88992","version":1769230493,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/kunzisoft/Android-KeyboardSwitcher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
