It allows you to make daily diary entries recording your condition and the intensity, location, nature and time of the pain you feel, as well as the medication you take and additional notes. Records of your pain can help health professionals gain an insight into the pain you are experiencing.\n\nThe main view of the app is a calendar. A new diary entry can be added and existing diary entries can be viewed by selecting a day in this calendar. Diary entries can be exported to PDF. You have to specify a period of time for which the entries are to be exported. You also have the option to share that PDF.\n\nPrivacy Friendly Pain Diary has a daily reminder function. If enabled, it displays a notification reminding you to make a diary entry if you have not made one yet. You can set the time at which you want to be reminded in the settings.\n\nHow does Privacy Friendly Pain Diary differ from other similar apps?\n1) Minimal permissions\nPrivacy Friendly Pain Diary requires write access to your device’s storage if you wish to\nexport your diary entries to PDF. All other features do not require any permissions.\n\n2) Protection of privacy\nUser data is not recorded, nor sent to any third party. The data you enter is only locally\nstored on your device.\n\n3) No advertisements or tracking mechanisms\nPrivacy Friendly Pain Diary distinguishes itself from many other applications in the way that it does not include any advertisements or tracking mechanisms. Advertisements can shorten battery life or consume mobile data, while tracking mechanisms can compromise privacy.\n\nPrivacy Friendly Pain Diary belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group at Karlsruhe Institue of Technology. Privacy Friendly Apps are Android applications which are optimized regarding privacy.
