It scans your media collection to identify <b>motion photos</b>, <b>panoramas</b> (aka photo spheres), <b>360Â° videos</b>, as well as <b>GeoTIFF</b> files.\n\n<b>Navigation and search</b> is an important part of <i>Aves</i>. The goal is for users to easily flow from albums to photos to tags to maps, etc.\n\n<i>Aves</i> integrates with Android (including Android TV) with features such as <b>widgets</b>, <b>app shortcuts</b>, <b>screen saver</b> and <b>global search</b> handling. It also works as a <b>media viewer and picker</b>.\n","repo":{"author":"Thibault Deckers","repo":"https://github.com/deckerst/aves"},"usrVersion":"333bff1ab286fdc3fcaaba3aa302ac2137b478f8954598eee324b617cfa8ba1f","version":1761056285,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/deckerst/aves","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
