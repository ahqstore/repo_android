It scans your media collection to identify <b>motion photos</b>, <b>panoramas</b> (aka photo spheres), <b>360Â° videos</b>, as well as <b>GeoTIFF</b> files.\n\n<b>Navigation and search</b> is an important part of <i>Aves</i>. The goal is for users to easily flow from albums to photos to tags to maps, etc.\n\n<i>Aves</i> integrates with Android (including Android TV) with features such as <b>widgets</b>, <b>app shortcuts</b>, <b>screen saver</b> and <b>global search</b> handling. It also works as a <b>media viewer and picker</b>.\n","repo":{"author":"Thibault Deckers","repo":"https://github.com/deckerst/aves"},"version":"65805cf7b39b475d441b9e667a8705b3bc20bf712460508f95120ee51826f0b4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/deckerst/aves","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,99,107,101,114,115,46,116,104,105,98,97,117,108,116,46,97,118,101,115,46,108,105,98,114,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,71,72,53,103,86,48,102,119,69,100,101,68,111,75,97,71,51,102,82,71,103,105,103,49,116,100,88,122,86,81,57,87,55,85,76,103,111,67,112,114,116,69,103,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
