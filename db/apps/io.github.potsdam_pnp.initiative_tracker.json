Once new devices join and lost devices rejoin, the state is exchanged.\n\nIn addition to the Android app, it can also be opened in a browser connected to the same network.\n\nIt supports the following Pathfinder 2 encounter rules:\n- Reordering when a character dies\n- Delaying turns\n- Ensuring player characters take their turn after non-player characters when they have the same initiative\n","repo":{"author":"Fabian Schmitthenner","repo":"https://github.com/potsdam-pnp/initiative-tracker"},"usrVersion":"7270ac10040b4f736ae941a37b71c7045b4852243806359f2f3febb2a7dbc83b","version":1760982024,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/potsdam-pnp/initiative-tracker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
