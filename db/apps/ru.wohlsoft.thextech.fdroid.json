This is a complete and extended port of source code of the SMBX 1.3 game engine originally writtein in MS Visual Basic 6, and its direct unofficial continuation after development of original halted in the 2011th year. This engine preserves full compatibility with levels and episodes made for the original SMBX game, including its repacks. And it's allowed to create brand-new Levels, Episodes, and content packs. Unlike the original SMBX game that depends on Windows and x86, TheXTech can work on many operating systems (including Linux distros, macOS, xBSD, Android, Haiku, etc.) and processor architectures (including x86_64, ARM, PowerPC, MIPS, etc.).\n\n**NOTE:** This is a runtime engine only.
