Seems like it's hidden. But\nwith this amazing app, you can get a sweet VIP pass to that awesome blue-light\nkiller.\n\nIf you're having trouble - make sure to click \"On\" in the top left rather than\nthe switch in the top right once it opens System UI Tuner.\n\nNote: On Android 7.1 and higher - this feature is officially built into the\noperating system, called Night Light. However, this feature requires a driver,\nand as a result, only is available on Pixel and Pixel XL (and newer devices). As\na result this will not work on Nexus devices on that version.","repo":{"author":"Michael Evans","repo":"https://github.com/MichaelEvans/NightModeEnabler"},"version":"a34752e70c7027001dcf5b92ffc69dc9fc6265cb255ca92b72867251f8424d52","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/MichaelEvans/NightModeEnabler","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,109,105,99,104,97,101,108,101,118,97,110,115,46,110,105,103,104,116,109,111,100,101,101,110,97,98,108,101,114,46,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
