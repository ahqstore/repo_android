I wanted to try something different—building from scratch while welcoming new developers and applying solid coding principles and best practices to keep the project alive for the long run. Open-source Launcher3 forks often end up abandoned because of their complexity, making it tough for newcomers to contribute. And, not gonna lie… a lot of them are still written in Java and rely on legacy APIs.\n\nMeanwhile, many closed-source launchers are starting to get greedy—locking features behind paywalls and sneaking in trackers. My goal is to give everyone the joy of using powerful features without compromising privacy.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/JackEblan/EblanLauncher"},"usrVersion":"a75eced5cdc544d827f3e3e37bf0d21694705d3efda15a859a327681ffc8a09e","version":1766262022,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JackEblan/EblanLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
