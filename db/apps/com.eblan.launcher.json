I wanted to try something different—building from scratch while welcoming new developers and applying solid coding principles and best practices to keep the project alive for the long run. Open-source Launcher3 forks often end up abandoned because of their complexity, making it tough for newcomers to contribute. And, not gonna lie… a lot of them are still written in Java and rely on legacy APIs.\n\nMeanwhile, many closed-source launchers are starting to get greedy—locking features behind paywalls and sneaking in trackers. My goal is to give everyone the joy of using powerful features without compromising privacy.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/JackEblan/EblanLauncher"},"usrVersion":"77797f5785db436aa0c70b482e454ffa0e31bf1f0d373165f1f8ed7c6f138926","version":1763586916,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JackEblan/EblanLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
