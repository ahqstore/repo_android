With <em>DevQS</em>, Developer Options can be toggled off then back on from the Quick Settings panel without resetting other settings. Long-clicking on any of the tiles will also open the Developer Options settings screen if the DEV toggle is on.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nThere is no launcher icon nor activity. The tiles must be manually added to the Quick Settings panel. The app requires the permission WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS which can be granted using ADB.\n<blockquote><tt>adb shell pm grant me.velc.devqs android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</tt></blockquote>","repo":{"author":"Louie Velarde","repo":"https://github.com/louie-velarde/DevQS"},"version":"46aecb316c08001024f10330af823c97de4d42bf386043d935692abf8a537eb9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/louie-velarde/DevQS","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,109,101,46,118,101,108,99,46,100,101,118,113,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,98,112,121,88,50,105,67,95,76,65,86,119,81,45,52,98,75,109,104,74,122,110,108,55,116,45,89,82,84,116,95,71,52,87,115,120,120,109,108,88,113,101,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
