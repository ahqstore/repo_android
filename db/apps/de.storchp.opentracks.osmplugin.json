These need to be downloaded and configured accordingly.\n\nOffline maps can be downloaded via the menu \"Map download\" or by visiting the above mentioned websites and click the download links. Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) require a long click on the link and \"Open link in external app\" and then choose OSMDashboard.\n\nManual downloaded offline maps or maps shared with other apps can be opened from your Android device.
