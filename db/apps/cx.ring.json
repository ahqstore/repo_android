Unlike the alternatives, Jami <b>calls are directly between users</b>, as it does not use servers to handle calls.\n\nThis gives the greatest privacy, as the <b>distributed</b> nature of Jami means your calls are only between participants.\n\nOne-to-one and <b>group conversations</b> with Jami are enhanced with instant messaging, audio and video calling, recording and sending audio and video messages, file transfers, screen sharing, and location sharing.\n\nJami can also function as a <b>SIP client</b>.\n\nMultiple <b>Jami extensions</b> are available: Audio Filter, Auto Answer, Green Screen, Segmentation, Watermark, and Whisper Transcript.\n\nJami can be easily deployed in organizations with the <b>JAMS (Jami Account Management Server)</b>, allowing users to connect with their corporate credentials or create local accounts. JAMS allows you to <b>manage your own</b> Jami community while taking advantage of Jami’s distributed network architecture.\n\nJami is <b>available for</b> GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Android TV, and web browsers, making Jami an interoperable and cross-platform communication framework.\n\n<b>Manage multiple</b> SIP accounts, Jami accounts, and JAMS accounts with the Jami client installed on one or multiple devices.\n\nJami is free, unlimited, private, advertising‑free, compatible, fast, autonomous, and anonymous.\n\n<b>Learn more about:</b>\nJami: https://jami.net/\nJami extensions: https://jami.net/extensions/\nJAMS (Jami Account Management Server): https://jami.biz/\nJami documentation: https://docs.jami.net/\n\n<b>Follow us for more:</b>\nMastodon: https://mstdn.io/@Jami\nVideos: https://docs.jami.net/videos/\n\n<b>We’d love to hear from you!
