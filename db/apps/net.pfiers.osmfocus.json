Click on one of the boxes if you want even more detailed information.\n\nChange the basemap (background layer) or add your own by going to the settings screen (cog icon).\n\nSource, issue tracking and more info:\nhttps://github.com/ubipo/osmfocus\n\nPermissions:\n\n- \"full network access\": display background map, retrieve OSM data\n- \"precise location\": (optional) move the map to the device's current location\n\n\nNotices:\n\nOSMfocus allows you to view OpenStreetMap data.
