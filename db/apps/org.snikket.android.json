It can be used to text and call with contacts without handing over your data to large corporations. This works because, instead of a centralized server, each group has their own private Snikket server under their control.\n\nTo get started you can choose:\n\n- Self-host your own Snikket instance using the open-source Snikket server software on any Linux server,\n- Use the simple hosting service provided by the Snikket not-for-profit organization,\n- Or join an existing instance of someone you know (they can send you an invitation).\n\nGuides are available at the snikket.org website.\n\nℹ️ Important note: Unlike many other messaging apps, there is no centralized Snikket service. The app requires a Snikket instance or invitation to get started.\n\nBoth the app and the server are 100% free and open source software.\n\nThe Snikket Android app is based on the excellent Conversations project by Daniel Gultsch.","repo":{"author":"Matthew Wild","repo":"https://github.com/snikket-im/snikket-android"},"usrVersion":"9782c3f9c6af4c2be94e89c829d3778bf95765c4fcaa55b1385cf9204a91f84a","version":1769341219,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/snikket-im/snikket-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
