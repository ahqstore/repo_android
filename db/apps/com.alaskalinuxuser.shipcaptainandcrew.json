In\ntimes past, this game was used as a gambling or drinking game by sailors and\nmerchants alike. You must procure a ship (6), a captain (5), and a crew (4), the\nremainder is your cargo.\n\nOnce you have your ship, captain, and crew, you can click on dice that you wish\nto hold in order to save them rather than roll them. You can also choose to keep\nthem all if the conditions are right. The \"point\" or high score is always\nvisible, and that is a big help to the \"hammer\" or the last player.\n\nThis game is open source and add free! So grab a couple friends and set sail for\nhigh adventure with this fun little dice game. If your lucky, you may even\nstrike \"midnight\"!","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/alaskalinuxuser/app_ship_capt_crew"},"version":"27fa16d5ae4014a484af4aa7439be8a7b1b68bb5305064cb7f48a625d2b63f7e","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/alaskalinuxuser/app_ship_capt_crew","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,97,108,97,115,107,97,108,105,110,117,120,117,115,101,114,46,115,104,105,112,99,97,112,116,97,105,110,97,110,100,99,114,101,119,46,49,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
