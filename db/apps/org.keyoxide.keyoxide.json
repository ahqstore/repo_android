In which case, keep these properties as separated as possible.\nBut if you’d like these properties to be linked and, by doing so, establish an online identity, you’ll need a clever solution.\n\nEnter Keyoxide.\n\nWhen you visit someone’s Keyoxide profile and see a green tick next to an account on some website,\nit was proven beyond doubt that the same person who set up this profile also holds that account.\n\n<b>App features</b>\n\n* Simple and straightforward UI\n* Onboarding\n* Guided tour\n* Fully open source\n* Built with Flutter\n* Supports fingerprint and email address as identifiers\n* Supports fetching, identities via keyservers and Web Key Directory\n* Search history\n* Contacts feature\n* ASP Profile management, create, edit, delete, import, export profiles, add claims directly within the app\n* Hide sensitive user profiles and protect with authentication\n* Disable animations and update check\n* Add multiple PGP or ASP profiles\n* Custom domain validation and support for profile upload and look-up\n* Check and display server update availability\n* Biometric, password, PIN or pattern authentication for profile management\n* User defined settings and data is saved in encrypted form\n* Deep linking with 'openpgp4fpr' and 'aspe' URL schemes\n* Localization, current available languages: German, English, Dutch, French, Galician, Polish, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese\n* Material 3 design\n* Adaptive themeable icons for Android\n* Accessibility enhancements such as semantic labels, dyslexic font, choice of seed color.\n\n<b>About Keyoxide</b>\n\n* Identity => verification using bidirectional linking\n* Secure => use of trusted cryptography\n* Decentralized => user data sovereignty\n* Privacy-friendly => data explicitly provided by identity holder\n\n\n","repo":{"author":"Berker Sen","repo":"https://codeberg.org/Berker/keyoxide-flutter"},"version":"1887672f852ea85f10d3a033ad88505b1bf2f5f5ea73207d83878c1374738975","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/Berker/keyoxide-flutter","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,107,101,121,111,120,105,100,101,46,107,101,121,111,120,105,100,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,72,70,103,108,120,50,88,90,83,87,97,75,55,53,82,75,114,49,53,53,55,104,70,79,90,85,81,122,80,55,100,88,77,95,70,109,109,67,51,110,73,80,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
