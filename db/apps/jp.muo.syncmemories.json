Try sync-memories to leverage your deviceâ€™s USB capability.\n\n * Direct transfer via USB\n * Normally, 3-4 times FASTER than Wi-Fi\n * Doesn't block device (phone/tablet) Wi-Fi\n * Skip synched files\n * Avoid redundant copying based on file size so corrupt (incomplete) files are re-transfered on the next sync\n * RAW image files (.ARW) supported\n * RAW files can be stored into separate directory so you can easily handle your backup preferences\n * e.g. send JPEG to Google Photos and send JPEG+RAW to Amazon Prime Photos\n","repo":{"author":"Kei Nakazawa","repo":"https://github.com/muojp/sync-memories"},"version":"68bfaffb73d753a668240eec8d3a47f0bafa67d77a63eb01de23449fe86f0005","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/muojp/sync-memories","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,106,112,46,109,117,111,46,115,121,110,99,109,101,109,111,114,105,101,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,111,83,86,81,111,111,98,85,103,49,80,88,105,95,98,95,121,53,66,117,68,68,107,109,115,68,76,65,122,76,90,107,57,56,107,108,102,48,52,48,108,107,103,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
