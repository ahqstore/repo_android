It is programmed to decide\nwhich block chain contains valid transactions. The users of Bitcoin Core\nonly accept transactions for that block chain, making it the Bitcoin block\nchain that everyone else wants to use.\n\nIt is these users who keep Bitcoin decentralized. They individually run\ntheir own Bitcoin Core full nodes, and each of those full nodes separately\nfollows the exact same rules to decide which block chain is valid.\n\nThere's no voting or other corruptible process involved: there's just\nindividual software following identical rules—\"math\"—to evaluate identical\nblocks and coming to identical conclusions about which block chain is\nvalid.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/greenaddress/abcore"},"version":"fdf8f1befbb9b33f205093b4bc4f5b778a4ed45b39e7e4ad5ef2136893d21a21","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/greenaddress/abcore","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,114,101,101,110,97,100,100,114,101,115,115,46,97,98,99,111,114,101,46,55,55,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
