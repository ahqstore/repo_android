If you need to reinstall \nthe app, the data will not be touched. That is good since you can handle many \nGB of data in the app. In the future there will hopefully be a separate app \ntaking care of keeping your data up to date, which is a simple task since \nsyncronization can be done based on timestamps of single geometries.\n\nThis project is still more of a \"proof of concept\". Any contributions to make \nit more complete and feature rich is welcome. Hopefully this can become a \nhealthy community project. \n\n''''The maps''''\nYou can get maps from \"ready to use\" databases or you can pack your own.\n\nA few maps that is \"ready to use\" can be downloded from \n[https://tilelessmap.org/maps/ https://tilelessmap.org/maps/]\n\nTo pack your own maps go to \n[https://github.com/TilelessMap/pg_tileless https://github.com/TilelessMap/pg_tileless]\n\n\nThe app as it stands now is built on top of these open source projects:\n\nSimple Direct Media Layer library, SDL, originally licensed under zlib license.\n[https://www.libsdl.org https://www.libsdl.org]\n\nSDL_image, originally licensed under zlib license\n[https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/]\n\nFreeType, originally released under FreeType License\n[https://www.freetype.org https://www.freetype.org]\n\nMini-XML, originally released under  [https://github.com/michaelrsweet/mxml/blob/master/COPYING Mini-XML license]\n[http://www.msweet.org/mxml http://www.msweet.org/mxml]\n\nuthash, originally released under [http://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/license.html BSD revised license]\n\nPoint in Polygon algorithm ported to C from Dan Sundays code\n[http://www.geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html http://www.geomalgorithms.com/a03-_inclusion.html]\n","repo":{"author":"Nicklas Av√©n","repo":"https://github.com/TilelessMap/TilelessMap"},"version":"e2c105397c9f36919a987a5cee9caf9d9d84d4353be23a77388410128532f5a5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/TilelessMap/TilelessMap","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,116,105,108,101,108,101,115,115,109,97,112,46,97,112,112,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
