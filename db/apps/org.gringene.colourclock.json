This makes the clock a bit more interesting,\nbecause each hand tells the time in a different way.\n\nOther apps by this developer: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gringene.concentricclock","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/gringer/ColourClock"},"version":"c2f897fa1a5b255c586100a10ba3c1c85927790cb4b7aac8062d5b813c267ffb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/gringer/ColourClock","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,103,114,105,110,103,101,110,101,46,99,111,108,111,117,114,99,108,111,99,107,46,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
