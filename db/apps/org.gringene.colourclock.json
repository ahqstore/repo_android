This makes the clock a bit more interesting,\nbecause each hand tells the time in a different way.\n\nOther apps by this developer: https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gringene.concentricclock","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/gringer/ColourClock"},"version":"c2f897fa1a5b255c586100a10ba3c1c85927790cb4b7aac8062d5b813c267ffb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/gringer/ColourClock","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":null,"verified":false}
