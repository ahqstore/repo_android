I wanted something much faster, so I built it myself.\n\n* Simple and clean interface\n* Light and dark mode support with a quick toggle\n* High BPM support (up to 600) beyond typical app limits\n* High beat number support (up to 20)\n* Completely free and open-source (GPLv3 License)\n* Free and most importantly, no ads\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/degD/yet_another_metronome"},"usrVersion":"5afaed325021e0f8bec493d5d1eb37f4f8d34053ef647837433e383442878a36","version":1766521309,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/degD/yet_another_metronome","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
