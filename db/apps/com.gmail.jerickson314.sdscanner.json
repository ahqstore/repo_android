Instead, an interface must be used that only\nallows one file to be specified at a time. This app works by determining what\nfiles/folders might need to be scanned again, and then by calling the correct\nAPI on each file/folder.\n\nSD Scanner can be used with Tasker by using the \"Send Intent\" action listed\nunder \"System.\" Use the following settings, leaving the ones I don't list at the\ndefault:\n\n* Action: android.intent.action.RUN\n* Package: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner\n* Class: com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner.MainActivity\n* Target: Activity","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/jerickson314/sdscanner"},"version":"3b8dfebd0860f143380d89140b7df36f524edf334de607cad0707db61a75503c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jerickson314/sdscanner","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,109,97,105,108,46,106,101,114,105,99,107,115,111,110,51,49,52,46,115,100,115,99,97,110,110,101,114,46,49,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
