Doze will only deactivate\nperiodically to execute maintenance jobs (like getting notifications, etc),\notherwise it will remain active as long as your screen is off. This brings a lot\nmore battery savings than standard Doze functionality, because even with screen\noff and Doze enabled, Doze is still periodically checking for movement, and\ndisabling motion sensing improves battery life further.\n\n**Features**\n\n* Force Doze mode immediately after screen off or after a user specified delay\n* Add/remove apps or packages directly to system Doze whitelist\n* Disable motion sensors to prevent Doze from kicking in during movement\n* Tasker support to turn on/off EnforceDoze and modify other features\n* Disable WiFi and mobile data completely during Doze\n* Ignore disabling Wifi/Data if music is playing\n* Ignore disabling Wifi/Data if hotspot is enabled\n* Enable Doze mode on devices where OEM has disabled it\n* No root mode so you can enjoy the core benefits without rooting your device ","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/farfromrefug/EnforceDoze"},"version":"4ac422037f34996b7f51ee654ae12f93c018bc2b8702354776856cb2a61de5ee","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/farfromrefug/EnforceDoze","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,97,107,121,108,97,115,46,101,110,102,111,114,99,101,100,111,122,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,54,80,97,80,118,77,50,72,106,76,100,71,95,67,113,71,121,81,53,56,74,72,103,106,105,53,88,104,55,100,107,110,88,75,84,85,83,54,79,67,81,68,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
