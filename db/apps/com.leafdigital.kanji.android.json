It is intended for Japanese language learners who might need to\nenter characters in order to look them up in a dictionary or enter them on a\nwebsite.\n\nIt identifies the character you have drawn using a special form of handwriting\nrecognition. You can select the correct character from a list. After entering\none or more characters, you can copy them into the clipboard as text for use in\na dictionary.\n\nNote that this will NOT work - at all - if you don't know basically how to draw\nkanji. If you just draw something any old way that looks like it, it certainly\nwon't be recognised. You have to draw characters basically the official way.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/quen/kanjirecog/tree/android"},"version":"2c3d7f63b4bc97a9414c68b6bb7f5a671b5c5363992c535edfe540504250fde4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/quen/kanjirecog/tree/android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,108,101,97,102,100,105,103,105,116,97,108,46,107,97,110,106,105,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
