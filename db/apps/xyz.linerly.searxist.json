(learn more at https://docs.searxng.org)\n\nWhen you use SearXNG, your search queries get proxied before passing it to various search engines. Not only you'll get various results, it also preserves privacy since the searches aren't directly linked to you.\n\nThe app provides a list of public instances from https://searx.space for you to use. If you have an instance (either that you host yourself or hosted by someone else), you can add it as well.\n\nIf you do use your own instance, make sure other people are also using it to blend in. If the instance is used by only one person, search engines can still link the searches back to you.\n\nThe app does not collect any information; it only passes search queries to the SearXNG instance that you use.\n","repo":{"author":"Linerly","repo":"https://codeberg.org/Linerly/searxist"},"usrVersion":"519f28b12d264b3ec7bf860446fab308cd6fa0de616e61362408b0fe4586dfce","version":1768512071,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/Linerly/searxist","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
