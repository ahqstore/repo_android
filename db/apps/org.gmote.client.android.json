It supports all of the standard remote control\nfeatures such as play, pause, rewind, volume controls etc. It also has a\nbuilt-in file browser that lets you select what to play. Some typical use-cases\nare people launching and controlling movies while sitting back on their couch,\nor listening to music.\n\nIt also has a touch pad feature which allows you to control your mouse from the\nphone, similar to a laptop touchpad (also sending keystrokes typed in on the\nphone to the computer). It's great for sitting back on the couch while watching\nyoutube or hulu.\n\nStatus: Version 2.0.7 elsewhere exists but there isn't any source","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://code.google.com/p/gmote/source"},"version":"0c2456bcb7201a6eb0e6a206b4b744fa57d1506b2340035f072fb1c4bca3ee03","site":null,"source":"https://code.google.com/p/gmote/source","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,103,109,111,116,101,46,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
