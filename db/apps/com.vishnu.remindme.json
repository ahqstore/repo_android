Got you covered.\n\nPS: `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission is used because Android wouldn't let me start an activity from the background. Hence, I display a transparent system overlay for a very small duration (500 ms), then open the alarm activity as soon as the overlay gets drawn, and close the overlay later.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VishnuSanal/RemindMe"},"usrVersion":"4d0b311db1d370ae5233313ab9b927cb7fc6a16c4afdb2b04aee4ced8d46e3e8","version":1768622851,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VishnuSanal/RemindMe","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
