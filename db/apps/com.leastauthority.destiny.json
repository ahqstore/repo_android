No sign-up is needed.\n\nThe user selects a file on their device and shares the generated code with the intended recipient for safe delivery.\n\nDestiny is based on the Magic Wormhole protocol.\n\nKey security features:\n\n- End-to-end encryption: Files are end-to-end encrypted and only the sender and recipient can read them.\n\n- Identity-less: No need to disclose identity information (such as name, email address, or phone number) to be able to transfer files.\n\n- Peer-to-peer file transfer: Destiny attempts to make a direct network connection to the other party. When this isn’t possible (for example, if neither party has a public IP address), then our relay server is used. However, that server sees only encrypted packets.\n\n- Full-strength keys: Although our codes are short and human-memorable, they are part of an online “Password Authenticated Key Exchange” (PAKE) which only allows a single guess – and yields a 256-bit full-strength symmetric key.\n","repo":{"author":"Least Authority TFA GmbH","repo":"https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny"},"version":"87162355727866f0946c688f03e38d25bcf790b66bc005263edca4590b4c9118","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,108,101,97,115,116,97,117,116,104,111,114,105,116,121,46,100,101,115,116,105,110,121,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,109,118,65,72,53,72,88,68,106,80,89,50,45,70,56,114,90,76,77,113,68,104,52,102,48,73,118,105,56,84,83,79,86,84,48,88,105,120,56,53,55,101,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
