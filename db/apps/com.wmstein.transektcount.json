It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nNew in Version 5.0.0:\n- This is a generally revised version that now implements optional GPS support to indicate a change of the current transect section. The use of GPS requires the provision of transect track data, described in the Help and the TransektCount_Userguide_5.0.0.pdf.\n- When activating GPS the app's name on the starting screen changes from TransektCount to TransektCountGPS.\n- With GPS activated the starting page shows a short hint message with the distance to the transect.\n- A toast message and a beep inform about entering a section different than the currently selected one.\n- Then, when visiting the page \"Transect Sections\" the name of the newly identified section is colored blue.\n- Optionally you may set the system permission for the TransektCount location service to \"Always on\" to get it reliably work for long inspections.\n- Program code has been adapted regarding aligned section and track handling for renaming, deleting and cloning a section.\n- The function \"Add a Further Section\" was moved from the Counting page to the page \"Transect Sections\".\n- The option to change the font size for comments was removed.\n- On relevant pages the number fields show dimmed \"0\"-values for better readability.\n- Picture and data of Nomophila noctuella (Rush veneer) added.\n- Some messages worded more clearly.\n- Under Settings, items \"Button Vibration\" and \"Proximity Sensor\" are grayed out if not available in device.\n- Under Settings, “GPS” is grayed out if no transect track is loaded.\n- Many other code and some picture improvements.\n- For debugging in Android Studio's emulator, permanent app specific support was added.\n- Docs updated.\n- Bugfix for sound-related crash under Android versions 7.1 - 10.\n- Other bugfixes.\n\nFeatures:\n- Data collection is based on a transect inspection.\n- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species.\n- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.\n- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount.\n- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg.\n- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/).\n- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC).\n- The help contains detailed user instructions.\n- TransektCount supports counting in German or English language.\n\nFunctions:\n- Duplicate and delete transect sections.\n- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).\n- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection.\n- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection.\n- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert.\n- GPS support for selecting the current section.\n- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThe app requires\n- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, \n- the permit to set the screen brightness, \n- the permit to prevent the sleep mode,\n- optionally the permit for exact GPS location recognition.\n\nThe smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1920 pixels.\nThe app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.\n\nDocumentation is provided under:\nhttps://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs.\n\nTransektCount is one of two apps for mon","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount"},"usrVersion":"9f56814712916cfc048693c7939fa0d43c951af6cd04f36f420f518d3c4fb185","version":1767813604,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
