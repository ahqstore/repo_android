It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nNew in Version 4.2.8:\n- Some code and text improvements\n- Bugfixes\n\nFeatures:\n- Data collection is based on a transect inspection\n- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species\n- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.\n- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount\n- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg\n- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de or new: web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)\n- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)\n- The help contains detailed user instructions\n\nFunctions:\n- Duplicate and delete transect sections.\n- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).\n- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection\n- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection\n- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert\n- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section\n\nPrerequisites:\nThe app requires\n- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, \n- the permit to set the screen brightness, \n- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.\n\nThe smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1920 pixels.\nThe app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.\n\nDocumentation is provided under:\nhttps://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs.\n\nTransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. \nThe second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. \n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount"},"usrVersion":"673f644d94c38821503bb6f298527050d1266d839b1c8fc9e0a32f4d017c02c3","version":1760006644,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
