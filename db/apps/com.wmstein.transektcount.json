It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nNew in Version 4.2.7:\n- Compiled for Android 16 (SDK 36)\n- Help and License info with new design\n- App info with background adjusted to new design\n- Adaptive app icon added for Android 16 (prevents white ring)\n- Some code and layout improvements\n- Pictures of Ennomos quercinaria and Eilema lurideola added\n- Docs updated\n- Bugfixes\n\nFeatures:\n- Data collection is based on a transect inspection\n- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to meta data, transect sections and expected species\n- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.\n- Export of the current species list for import by TourCount and TransektCount\n- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg\n- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de or new: web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)\n- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)\n- The help contains detailed user instructions\n\nFunctions:\n- Duplicate and delete transect sections.\n- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).\n- Editor for meta data in preparation for an inspection\n- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection\n- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert\n- The results page shows meta data, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section\n\nPrerequisites:\nThe app requires\n- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, \n- the permit to set the screen brightness, \n- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.\n\nThe smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1024 x 1920 pixels.\nThe app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.\n\nDocumentation is provided under:\nhttps://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs.\n\nTransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. \nThe second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. \n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount"},"version":"379531f357f3af565e05731fb9fb67514afbf3997033fdc46a10893489a739a1","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
