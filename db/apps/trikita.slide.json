To make up for this, a presenter will use many more\nslides than in a traditional presentation, each slide being shown for a much\nshorter duration.\n\nThe slides use plain text in a visual manner, to help the audience quickly read\nand understand the material. It's said to be helpful with Japanese and other\neastern languages which use non-Latin alphabets.\n\nThe method is designed for the people who are not good at presentations and who\nare quite nervous about the idea of presenting. This method helps the presenter\nto get organized during the talk and keeps the presenter on track while\npresenting. The method provides clear visual support for the audience and helps\nmake the content more memorable.","repo":{"author":"Trikita","repo":"https://github.com/trikita/slide"},"version":"f341f3600a33f90bcbcbce46111978fff848bae8ed5416be8065a4c0dc66ab98","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/trikita/slide","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,116,114,105,107,105,116,97,46,115,108,105,100,101,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
