All Stetho functions are given besides Network Monitoring. For this\nhowever I highly recommend using mitmproxy or tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\nThis Module can be used for Reverse Engineering. Especially the Layout Preview\nis very useful. Please also take a look at Inspackage since this will add even\nmore functions for this purpose.\n\nATTENTION:Never leave this Module enabled or installed on day to day use. THIS\nIS A SECURITY RISK. Only enable this for Development.","repo":{"author":"Christian Schabesberger","repo":"https://gitlab.com/derSchabi/Stethox"},"version":"6845b2a89d36227464c155d12ffb0d5b26981c8a1ffe3fe5a3210f5a2a9e432e","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/derSchabi/Stethox","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,115,99,104,97,98,105,46,115,116,101,116,104,111,120,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
