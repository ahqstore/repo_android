Its goal is to move all cards to the foundations. A detailed description of the rules can be found in the app's help site.\n\nWhich features offers Privacy Friendly Solitaire?\n\nPrivacy Friendly Solitaire provides different difficulty levels that draw either one or three cards from the deck. Additionally there are the following versions of counting points:\n- None: No points are counted.\n- Standard: The Player starts with zero points, moves give different points.\n- Vegas: The Player starts at -52 points and tries to get more than zero points, while the deck can only be passed through one time.\n\nThe Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings).\nAddtionally he can undo and redo moves. Optionally he is shown the time of play.\nWhen the game is almost won (meaning that there are no more cards turned face-down), it will finish automatically.\n\nHow does Privacy Friendly Solitaire differ from other similar apps?\n\n1) No permissions\nPrivacy Friendly Solitaire does not require any permission.\nFor comparison: The Top Ten similar apps from the Google Play Store, require an average of 11,1 permissions (March 2018). These are for instance the permission to access accounts, permissions to access, modify or delete storage and access to networks or the internet.\n\n2) No advertisement\nMoreover, Privacy Friendly Solitaire distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.\n\nThis app is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group\ndeveloped by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n","repo":{"author":"SECUSO - Security Usability Society","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-solitaire"},"version":"b0e2adf991f949821fb28389b7c91ea2e1f743dc22c47a5738bc5980b66603ae","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-solitaire","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,115,101,99,117,115,111,46,112,114,105,118,97,99,121,102,114,105,101,110,100,108,121,115,111,108,105,116,97,105,114,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,117,81,111,105,56,90,108,76,117,55,114,56,79,49,105,54,88,117,76,67,55,117,51,109,97,45,95,80,101,87,54,80,119,99,107,116,76,87,104,98,110,50,65,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
