Note that this app comes without UI and therefore has no icon in the app drawer. But of course it is listed in the Android settings (e.g. for uninstallation).\n\n<b>It is strongly recommended to read the project page to learn more about compatibility and limitations.</b>\n\nThis app is NOT compatible with devices running Google Play Services or microg, installation will fail on these devices. Also, the original Gcam (unmodded) version 7.6 or newer requires a compatible Android version (OS/ROM). More information about this on the project page as well.\n\nProject page:\nhttps://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider","repo":{"author":"Lukas Pieper","repo":"https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider"},"version":"8fb95c15eb4b374e8f0e3650e942b962f47f18bc36ee1d62ffa2fb53c9e1de9a","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/lukaspieper/Gcam-Services-Provider","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
