Various\ngroups are organising decentralised events with talks, workshops and\nother things in the usual Congress season. Parts of these events can\nbe visited in person and other parts can be followed online.\n\nWe have prepared an overview of all these events, sorted by (physical)\nlocation. All broadcasts will be viewable on media.ccc.de live and as\nrecordings later.\n\nPlease remember that the individual groups are organising these events\nautonomously and are individually responsible for their own content.\n\n<b>Features</b>\n* View program by day and rooms (side by side)\n* Custom grid layout for smartphones (try landscape mode 🙃) and tablets\n* Read detailed descriptions (speaker names, start time, room name, links, ...) of events\n* Add events to favorites list\n* Export favorites list\n* Setup alarms for individual events\n* Add events to your personal calendar\n* Share a website link to an event with others\n* Keep track of program changes\n* Automatic program updates (configurable in settings)\n* Vote and leave comments on talks and workshops\n* Integration with the Engelsystem project <a href=\"https://engelsystem.de\">https://engelsystem.de</a> - Online tool for coordinating helpers and shifts on large events\n* Integration with the Chaosflix <a href=\"https://github.com/NiciDieNase/chaosflix\">https://github.com/NiciDieNase/chaosflix</a> - Android app for <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de\">https://media.ccc.de</a>, share Fahrplan favorites with Chaosflix to import them as bookmarks\n\n🔤 <b>Supported languages</b>\n(Event descriptions excluded)\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Russian\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n\n💡 Questions regarding the content can only be answered by the\ncontent teams of the individual events. This app simply\noffers a way to consume and personalize the aggregated schedule\nof all the events.\n\n💣 Bug reports are very welcome.
