There is no need to have the screen\non all the time, so the user can switch the screen off and still continue to use\nonly the buttons.\n\nThe phone doesn't enter deep sleep, but since the screen is the biggest consumer\nit saves quite a lot of battery and allows for long periods of continuous usage.\n\nThis app works like most remote controls, just download the server on the\ncomputer and enter the ip address into the app. However, the server is a Java\njar-file and so no installation is needed and usage is very simple.\n\nAnti-Feature: Uses a link with advertisement to the download of the server part.\nHowever, there is an optional direct link without advertisement.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Cherubin7th/BlackSCREENpREsENtAtIONremote"},"version":"7617896aa9a41a0fb3e4b06105d96f965f54e64025d38de7a1f84fc76ea2760d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Cherubin7th/BlackSCREENpREsENtAtIONremote","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
