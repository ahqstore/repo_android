It uses GPS to retrieve current position and SMS for requests/responses.\n\nSMS request format: `Loc?`\nSMS response format: `Loc:LAT,LON,ASL,UTC_S,V_KMH,ACC_M,BAT_PCT`, where:\n - `LAT, LON` are latitude and longitude in degrees rounded up to 4 decimal places.[^1]\n - `ASL` or Above Sea Level is the absolute altitude as reported by the GPS in meters\n - `UTC_S` is the timestamp of the GPS fix in seconds. The timestamp corresponds to the time of the actual fix, and not when SMS was received.\n - `V_KMH` is the speed in kilometers/hour\n - `ACC_M` is the accuracy reported by the GPS chip in meters\n - `BAT_PCT` is the battery percentage of the device sending the response\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/wandomium/SmsLoc"},"usrVersion":"f479c94acb6f1d4449d3036e5b8e4079f85b2a9bc8f135c601d341bff9e79239","version":1766899437,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wandomium/SmsLoc","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
