It can be configured via MDM (Mobile Device Management) policies.\n\nCertificates can be automatically (silently) enrolled and renewed if delegated scope CERT_INSTALL is granted and SCEP connection details are configured via MDM/EMM. Plus it can be used as certificate selection app (private key mapping) if delegated scope CERT_SELECTION is granted, based on \"cert-to-app\" selection rules configured via MDM/EMM policy.\n\nIt can also be used to monitor the expiration of your personal certificates and send you a notification a couple of days before.\n\nAdditionally, it provides a manual Certificate Signing Request (CSR) creation feature and a PEM to PKCS12 converter.\n","repo":{"author":"Georg Sieber","repo":"https://github.com/schorschii/Droid_SCEP"},"usrVersion":"c107ad9782c66aa3579975dbb373cd71a81853e655b8101136da14b3f771f86a","version":1769197314,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/schorschii/Droid_SCEP","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
