The glasses go down from full to empty at each tap. Alarm of your chosen duration (re)starts every time you touch a glass.\n\nA 'Drink water!' notification will be displayed if you have not 'drank' for your chosen duration. Tapping the notification goes to the app.\n\nWhen all 5 glasses are empty, the notifications will no longer come (until you restart them), and a 'Congratulations' message will appear.\n","repo":{"author":"ktprograms","repo":"https://github.com/ktprograms/WaterTracker"},"version":"ccd6744be2da9109d4d446075c25efcbaa6f8913a48908df8692b479d2a453a2","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ktprograms/WaterTracker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,107,116,112,114,111,103,114,97,109,115,46,119,97,116,101,114,116,114,97,99,107,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,77,52,88,57,75,72,84,81,45,108,73,52,55,70,122,120,99,84,99,107,95,89,110,97,104,103,87,83,65,85,67,55,87,117,49,51,89,75,85,83,95,100,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
