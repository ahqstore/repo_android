The interface is kept minimal to allow operation in\nsituations that do not permit extensive interaction with the phone (e.g. while\ndriving a car).\n\nBookmarks are color coded. Blue icons represent exact locations, red icons mean\nthat the widget could not get a GPS fix within 40 seconds and therefore recorded\nthe last known GPS location.\n\nIn order to view a bookmark, a suitable maps application needs to be installed\n(e.g. https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/onyxbits/geobookmark"},"version":"9fa3d54e2a4b01721272cda74608cf8dd3928de2e9960d376d0095553b46bdaf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/onyxbits/geobookmark","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,111,110,121,120,98,105,116,115,46,103,101,111,98,111,111,107,109,97,114,107,46,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
