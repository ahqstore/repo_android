It provides a comprehensive set of common tools,\nso that you can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel.\n\nThe Android editor is currently in an experimental stage. The UI has not been adapted\nfor touch screens yet; using a hardware keyboard and mouse is strongly recommended.\nCurrently, android version of godot editor doesn't support exporting projects.\n\nThis is a 4.x branch of godot editor. It provides a massive overhaul of the\nengine with many new features. It's advised to use 3.x branch of godot editor\nfor stability and compatibility with older godot projects.\n\nScreenshots for projects in asset library are automatically downloaded\nwhen browsing.
