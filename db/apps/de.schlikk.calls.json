After the call the volume is reset to the previous setting.\nIf your phone is in DoNotDisturb mode however, nothing is changed.\n\nEnable reading of the phone numbers so that the app can see who is calling you.\nWith this you can set a different volume for each number.\n\nGrant permission ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY (optional) to enable the app to toggle your phone's DoNotDisturb mode.\nWith this you can mark numbers as important. The app will deactivate DoNotDisturb mode iff an important number calls you.\n","repo":{"author":"Schlikk","repo":"https://gitlab.com/schlikk/calls"},"version":"594b45eaeb4620b9bfbc01eae625535da4f5c5fd6e6745bc3f401a85621f52fe","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/schlikk/calls","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,115,99,104,108,105,107,107,46,99,97,108,108,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,75,76,100,101,107,70,85,89,119,72,103,108,83,51,71,115,119,113,85,52,120,121,81,88,86,119,70,122,110,119,70,109,119,108,90,79,86,71,54,49,69,77,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
