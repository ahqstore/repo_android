However, in\nstock Android, the password used to generate the encryption key is identical to\nthat used to unlock the screen. That either forces you to use weak password, or\nto type long secure password each time you unlock the screen of device. This\napplication uses standard VDC calls to validate and set a new password. The app\nhas been tested on the developer's Galaxy Nexus: however, please backup your\ndata before using this app! If you forget your password, you will NEVER recover\nyour data!\n\nRequires Root: Yes.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/kibab/encpasschanger"},"version":"ff025bfc42cf0474427f1dc6365d2a7594128a503115f5de19707519d7c58e2c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kibab/encpasschanger","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,107,105,98,97,98,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,69,110,99,80,97,115,115,67,104,97,110,103,101,114,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
