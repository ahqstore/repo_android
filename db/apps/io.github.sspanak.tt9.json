It provides predictive text input in 40+ languages, configurable hotkeys, clipboard, undo/redo, and extensive customization. It works on touchscreens, hardware keypads, and TV remote controls. And best of all, it doesn't spy on you!\n\nSupported languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Simplified Chinese (Pinyin), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati (phonetic), Hebrew, Hindi (phonetic), Hinglish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese (Romaji), Kiswahili, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (European and Brazilian), Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Moroccan Tamazight (Latin and Tifinagh), Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Yiddish.\n\nPhilosophy:\n- No spying, tracking, telemetry, reports, or data collection of any sort.\n- No ads or unnecessary bells and whistles. It only does its job, typing.\n- No unnecessary network connections. The Full version operates entirely offline, and the Lite version connects only to download dictionaries from GitHub. Voice Input may require Internet access, depending on the available voice services.\n- Open-source, permitting you to verify all the above yourself.\n- Created with help from the entire community.\n- Things it will (probably) never have: QWERTY layout, swipe-typing, GIFs, and stickers.\n- Not intended as a clone of TouchPal, Sony Ericsson, KaiOS, Samsung, etc. While it captures the feel of the classics, TT9 offers its own experience and won’t replicate any device or app exactly.\n\n\nThank you for understanding, and enjoy TT9!\n","repo":{"author":"Dimo Karaivanov","repo":"https://github.com/sspanak/tt9"},"usrVersion":"6db81d83aabf2ddb4043e12432f5257f6d48ef8c0f89f08d5fdd8145252f1f94","version":1768290328,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sspanak/tt9","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
