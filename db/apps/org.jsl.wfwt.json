Unfortunately Android NSD implementation is not stable enough, so\nsometimes application can not establish connection properly. Application restart\nor device reboot usually helps. Audio data is being transmitted by the unicast\nchannel, so each device works as a server and as a client at the same time.\n\nProgram was implemented as a demonstration of JS-Collider: Java high performance\nscalable NIO framework, see <a href=\"https://github.com/js-labs/js-collider\">https://github.com/js-labs/js-collider</a>.","repo":{"author":"Sergey Zubarev","repo":"https://github.com/js-labs/WalkieTalkie"},"version":"fd2a982321eaaaac166763b5ec875cfead616f3986b359376ee43162c7261aaa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/js-labs/WalkieTalkie","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
