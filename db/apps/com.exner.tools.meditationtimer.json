It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, it is a simpler version of Foto Timer, and a rewrite of the original Meditation Timer for PalmOS from 20 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer is working with \"processes\", which define how Meditation Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be \"chained\" together, meaning that a process can automatically lauch another.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer contains absolutely no AI whatsoever.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/janexner/MeditationTimerAndroid"},"version":"d1b575d64106f6359a80bf0040d73b0fcd44736347291c8a9e30d21f9752498b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/janexner/MeditationTimerAndroid","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,101,120,110,101,114,46,116,111,111,108,115,46,109,101,100,105,116,97,116,105,111,110,116,105,109,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,102,104,113,75,97,84,87,83,108,119,78,106,118,120,74,122,45,116,75,66,84,122,116,122,76,105,70,73,103,102,102,119,53,82,88,112,45,82,112,67,83,77,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
