It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, it is a simpler version of Foto Timer, and a rewrite of the original Meditation Timer for PalmOS from 20 years ago.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer is working with \"processes\", which define how Meditation Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be \"chained\" together, meaning that a process can automatically lauch another.</p>\n\n<p>Meditation Timer contains absolutely no AI whatsoever.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/jexner/MeditationTimerAndroid"},"usrVersion":"b2fc3e13427f3501ee6048524375e496935a45a8decf5e19ea8c5ee3060ceb57","version":1760899505,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/jexner/MeditationTimerAndroid","license_or_tos":"EUPL-1.2","resources":null,"verified":false}
