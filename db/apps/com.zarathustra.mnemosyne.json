One can also export lists to save elsewhere.\n\nThere is a feature that allows for placing related lists together in a collapsible group.\nOne can nest these groups to near arbitrary depth. One creates a group by prefixing the group title to the list title, followed by \"::\".\nFor example, to create a grouping of German lists, where one wants a list of nouns and a list of verbs, one would name the two lists German::Nouns and German::Verbs.\n","repo":{"author":"Santiago Orellana","repo":"https://github.com/aptaabye/Mnemosyne"},"version":"7e3e657f5782cdaf4b5eacef6d5831543f31685de9f3b629241c36fa2fbaf913","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/aptaabye/Mnemosyne","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,122,97,114,97,116,104,117,115,116,114,97,46,109,110,101,109,111,115,121,110,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,53,69,82,112,114,89,69,88,100,77,103,112,66,97,67,101,74,108,48,111,115,85,80,115,81,115,54,89,72,53,100,101,109,82,122,95,113,109,66,110,119,80,81,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
