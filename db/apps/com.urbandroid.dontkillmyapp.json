You can measure before setting up your phone, then go through the setup guides and benchmark again to see how much has your phone been slacking in the background.\n\nYou can share your report through the app to the maintainers of the dontkillmyapp.com website who compile it and base the overall negative score on it.\n\nHow does the benchmark work? (Technical!)\n\nThe app starts a foreground service with a wake lock and schedules repetitive task on the main thread, a custom thread executor and schedules regular alarms (AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle). Then it calculates executed vs. expected. That's it!\n\nFor more details check the code. The app is open source available it https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dontkillmy-app\n\nSpecial thanks to Doki (github.com/doubledotlabs/doki).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dontkillmy-app"},"version":"325da54c1d8a360bcec0777cd55e4654896c8d583669f312641e36fbaf2e0672","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dontkillmy-app","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,117,114,98,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,100,111,110,116,107,105,108,108,109,121,97,112,112,46,50,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
