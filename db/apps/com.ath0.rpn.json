RPN\ncalculators may be in the minority but they are easy to learn and very\nefficient. The idea is that the operator follows the operands, so that instead\nof typing 2 + 2 =, one types 2 enter 2 enter +. The left arrow either deletes\nthe last digit or drops the last item from the stack. The up arrow show a few\nother functions such as setting the number of decimal points, swapping items on\nthe stack and the use of exponents.","repo":{"author":"ATH0","repo":"https://github.com/lpar/RPN"},"version":"52e1f234710ebdf087e6760d0a0e4ff5d969f142b44ab61d1ce05ff526bd2bda","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/lpar/RPN","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
