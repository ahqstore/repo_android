This makes it impossible to switch back and forth between the two. This Xposed module sets the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag when starting a new activity, which 'fixes' that (note to devs: only startActivity is hooked for obvious reasons.) Note that this module may break things.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/GermainZ/ActivityForceNewTask"},"version":"81803d44ea02980dd31ddf604bf58430e34979e57ea0dafb59ba5e8541709249","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/GermainZ/ActivityForceNewTask","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,101,114,109,97,105,110,122,46,97,99,116,105,118,105,116,121,102,111,114,99,101,110,101,119,116,97,115,107,46,50,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
