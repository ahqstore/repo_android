This makes it impossible to switch back and forth between the two. This Xposed module sets the FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag when starting a new activity, which 'fixes' that (note to devs: only startActivity is hooked for obvious reasons.) Note that this module may break things.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/GermainZ/ActivityForceNewTask"},"usrVersion":"81803d44ea02980dd31ddf604bf58430e34979e57ea0dafb59ba5e8541709249","version":1760646019,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/GermainZ/ActivityForceNewTask","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
