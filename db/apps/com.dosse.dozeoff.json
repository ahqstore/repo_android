Some ROMs are worse than others, with MIUI being the worst offender and AOSP being somewhat tolerable.\n\nDozeOff automatically disables Doze when the system is booted on your rooted device, simple as that.\n\nOn Android 12L and newer, DozeOff will also disable Phantom Process Killing.\n\nYou can also choose keep the CPU and WiFi awake at all times, but this will drain the battery very quickly.\n","repo":{"author":"Federico Dossena","repo":"https://github.com/adolfintel/DozeOff"},"version":"52329c5566ae5dc8071267f4c10df48a2c8e37eef26bed1032d8823efea96339","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/adolfintel/DozeOff","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
