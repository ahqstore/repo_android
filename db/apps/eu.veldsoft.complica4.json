In Complica (not like in Connect\nFour), when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game.\nAnother piece may be used to slide the entire row over. Winner is first person\nto have 4 pieces in a row. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each\nplayer can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to\ncontinue until this situation can be broken up.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Complica4"},"version":"7d3bcee523829d75889c04da1793af4ea4a9cdd1e70462e764882e5924907fb9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Complica4","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,101,117,46,118,101,108,100,115,111,102,116,46,99,111,109,112,108,105,99,97,52,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
