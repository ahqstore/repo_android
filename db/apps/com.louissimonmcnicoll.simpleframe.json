Accordingly the app does not have any networking features since these old devices are often inherently insecure.\n\nSupports local files only. I suggest transfering the files from a computer using a USB connection.\n\nFeatures:\n- Display pictures of a local folder in a slideshow\n- 12 slideshow transitions\n- Customizable time before changing picture\n- Option to scale the pictures to fit the screen\n- Can randomize the picture order\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Louis-Simon22/simpleframe"},"usrVersion":"4e916fca7bc20cc5b9591647dbfd3e54de6e2bbbc0fa6d57a81308da2c791579","version":1761232811,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Louis-Simon22/simpleframe","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
