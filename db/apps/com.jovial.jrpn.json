This is an RPN-based calculator that works in floating point,\nand integers expressed in hex, decimal, octal or binary.  I modified Emmet's \nWRPN (with permission) so that it uses rendered fonts for the keys. This \nmakes them look nice and crisp on high resolution displays.\n\nI offer this software as-is, with no guarantee of any kind. The source is \navailable on github. There's also a desktop Java version -- see \nhttps://jrpn.jovial.com/ for both.\n","repo":{"author":"Bill Foote","repo":"https://github.com/zathras/JRPN_Android"},"version":"929a8fb1d0dc51979cab73e13708cb64d8a0b67c6176ed51c9452d294418ce54","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/zathras/JRPN_Android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,106,111,118,105,97,108,46,106,114,112,110,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,89,76,117,80,87,66,98,89,79,53,78,81,87,70,71,78,85,87,56,111,102,122,112,74,76,79,85,70,120,84,83,53,103,67,56,84,107,109,122,120,83,106,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
