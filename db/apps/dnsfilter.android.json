It hooks into\nthe domain name (DNS) resolution and returns the loopback address for\nfiltered hosts.\n\nIt can be used for filtering ads and other unwished hosts based on a host\nlist â€“ thus it is a good AdBlock alternative. On Android 4.2 and newer it\ncan be used as effective ad, malware and tracking server filter without\nroot access!\n\nIt works with any upstream DNS server - filtering is completely local - no\nphoning home or such things! You can run it locally on your device or\ncentrally as DNS server in your network.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter"},"version":"636cc373fad7bc3a93897b64c79458ad08bd2c2dd797fec4fb61a3298b1e01c0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
