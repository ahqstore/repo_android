It hooks into\nthe domain name (DNS) resolution and returns the loopback address for\nfiltered hosts.\n\nIt can be used for filtering ads and other unwished hosts based on a host\nlist â€“ thus it is a good AdBlock alternative. On Android 4.2 and newer it\ncan be used as effective ad, malware and tracking server filter without\nroot access!\n\nIt works with any upstream DNS server - filtering is completely local - no\nphoning home or such things! You can run it locally on your device or\ncentrally as DNS server in your network.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter"},"usrVersion":"974180eb5a69a48426d6a9f97e6be4f2aabb615d1974869ceb3ed4f14ff1c4da","version":1760606453,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
