It hooks into\nthe domain name (DNS) resolution and returns the loopback address for\nfiltered hosts.\n\nIt can be used for filtering ads and other unwished hosts based on a host\nlist – thus it is a good AdBlock alternative. On Android 4.2 and newer it\ncan be used as effective ad, malware and tracking server filter without\nroot access!\n\nIt works with any upstream DNS server - filtering is completely local - no\nphoning home or such things! You can run it locally on your device or\ncentrally as DNS server in your network.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter"},"version":"637b64861c93ac289cab372b33ca4660c9934f4ad6f421f401f7be7c0d34e689","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/IngoZenz/personaldnsfilter","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
