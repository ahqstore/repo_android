It supports many different <b>skills</b> and input/output methods, and it provides both <b>speech</b> and <b>graphical</b> feedback to a question.

It has <b>multilanguage</b> support, and is currently available in Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Russian, Slovenian and Spanish, Ukrainian.\n\nDicio answers questions about:\n<ul>\n<li><b>search</b>: looks up information on <b>DuckDuckGo</b> (and in the future more engines) - <i>Search for Dicio</i></li>\n<li><b>weather</b>: collects weather information from <b>OpenWeatherMap</b> - <i>What's the weather like?</i></li>\n<li><b>lyrics</b>: shows <b>Genius</b> lyrics for songs - <i>What's the song that goes we will we will rock you?</i></li>\n<li><b>open</b>: opens an app on your device - <i>Open NewPipe</i></li>\n<li><b>calculator</b>: evaluates basic calculations - <i>What is four thousand and two times three minus a million divided by three hundred?</i></li>\n<li><b>telephone</b>: view and call contacts - <i>Call Tom</i></li>\n<li><b>timer</b>: set, query and cancel timers - <i>Set a timer for eleven minutes</i></li>\n<li><b>current time</b>: query current time - <i>What time is it?</i></li>\n<li><b>navigation</b>: opens the navigation app at the requested position - <i>Take me to New York, fifteenth avenue</i></li>\n</ul>\n\nDicio can receive input through a text box or through <a href=\"https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/\">Vosk</a> <i>speech to text</i>, and can talk using toasts or the Android <i>speech synthesis</i> engine. <b>Interactive graphical output</b> is provided by skills when they answer a question.\n\nEach skill can be enabled, disabled or customized using the related settings screen. Dark, black and dynamic color themes are available.\n\nThe user input is interpreted by specific, yet reusable, libraries: <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler\">dicio-sentences-compiler</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-numbers\">dicio-numbers</a>.\n\nThis app has the <i>NonFreeNet</i> anti-feature because some skills use non-free services to obtain the information requested by the user. You can easily disable unwanted skills or choose alternative services via settings.\n","repo":{"author":"Stypox","repo":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android"},"version":"b1c67a04dbfe1783b40d90cf6e2c2f38fe715e5425a6a124402133f89632b3f6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,115,116,121,112,111,120,46,100,105,99,105,111,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,84,48,49,98,71,109,67,81,67,113,113,105,90,110,117,116,120,79,51,120,110,45,107,108,71,97,74,109,111,88,95,98,112,48,80,112,78,107,45,100,95,82,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
