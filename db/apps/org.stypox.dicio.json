Dark, black and dynamic color themes are available.\n\nThe user input is interpreted by specific, yet reusable, libraries: <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-sentences-compiler\">dicio-sentences-compiler</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-numbers\">dicio-numbers</a>.\n\nThis app has the <i>NonFreeNet</i> anti-feature because some skills use non-free services to obtain the information requested by the user. You can easily disable unwanted skills or choose alternative services via settings.\n","repo":{"author":"Stypox","repo":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android"},"usrVersion":"6dd871f30c411648810b2d96f2de2bc4a28f57232e6b4e71cde669871eddc481","version":1761313733,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Stypox/dicio-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
