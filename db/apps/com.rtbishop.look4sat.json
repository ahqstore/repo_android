It is now and always will be completely ad-free and open-source.\n\n<b>Main features:</b><ul>\n<li>Predicting satellite positions and passes for up to a week</li>\n<li>Showing the list of currently active and upcoming satellite passes</li>\n<li>Showing the active pass progress, polar trajectory and transceivers info</li>\n<li>Showing the satellite positional data, footprint and ground track on a map</li>\n<li>Custom TLE data import is available via files with TXT or TLE extensions</li>\n<li>Offline first: calculations are made offline. Weekly update of TLE data is recommended.</li></ul>","repo":{"author":"Arty Bishop","repo":"https://github.com/rt-bishop/Look4Sat"},"version":"6094372643fd42654fea73aa2a0c41ff81a85ff9249608b28e5534e6f9275b45","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/rt-bishop/Look4Sat","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,114,116,98,105,115,104,111,112,46,108,111,111,107,52,115,97,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,68,112,80,122,106,118,77,81,65,51,118,88,95,75,119,85,45,84,54,76,68,100,117,113,100,106,111,112,90,57,67,122,85,116,102,116,84,109,51,71,57,73,115,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
