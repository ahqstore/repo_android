To create a geo: link, geographic coordinates are required. Geo Share extracts them from the map URL.\n\nHowever, not all map URLs include coordinates. In such cases, Geo Share will prompt you for permission to connect to the map service (Google Maps, Apple Maps etc.) and retrieve the coordinates from either HTTP headers or the HTML document of the link. For more detailed information, check the app's FAQ screen.\n","repo":{"author":"Jakub Valenta","repo":"https://github.com/jakubvalenta/geoshare"},"usrVersion":"61124cdfae5e2599ef495e54e69e86035040e02601c3dfe0f9ab268a2c37e501","version":1762770154,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jakubvalenta/geoshare","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
