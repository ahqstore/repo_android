To create a geo: link, geographic coordinates are required. Geo Share extracts them from the map URL.\n\nHowever, not all map URLs include coordinates. In such cases, Geo Share will <b>prompt you for permission to connect to the map service (Google Maps, Apple Maps etc.)</b> and retrieve the coordinates from either HTTP headers or the HTML document of the link.
