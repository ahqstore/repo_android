That means if you stay connected for shorter period, the reminder may not appear.\n\nYou can also specify mobile network CellID to trigger reminder if no Wifi connection is available. This method may be unreliable if your device is constantly switching between cells it connects to.\n\nWith version 1.2.5 and below running on Android 7 (Nougat) and below you could set reminders for any connected or just available (with polling turned on) wireless network.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/glsk/wifireminders"},"usrVersion":"9032a3a47db27f08679c0a10901dd816976bd24bc98e90637d834df45058059b","version":1760272403,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/glsk/wifireminders","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
