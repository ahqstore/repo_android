It basically means that this app can run without showing itself. However the app will always show a notification when it is running.\n\n<h2>Automatic screenshots:</h2>If you want to automate screenshots from another app, e.g. MacroDroid or Tasker, you can find a step-by-step guide here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile#automatic-screenshots-with-broadcast-intents\">github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile#automatic-screenshots-with-broadcast-intents</a>\n\n<h2>Hiding the app icon:</h2>In the app settings you can hide the app icon from your launcher. You can still access the app by long pressing the tile in your quick settings. Unfortunately, Android 10 does not allow hiding an app anymore.\n\n<h2>üåé Support and translations</h2>If there is a problem or you want to help translate this app into your language, please contact me on <a href=\"https://github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile/issues\">github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile/issues</a>, <a href=\"mailto:cuzi-android@openmail.cc\">cuzi-android@openmail.cc</a> or contribute a translation on <a href=\"https://crowdin.com/project/screenshottile/\">https://crowdin.com/project/screenshottile/</a>\n\nThis app can access the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491\">Accessibility Services API</a> which allows this app to record the screen. Data is neither collected nor shared by this app using the accessibility capabilities.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile"},"version":"6ec63a136f4704b7e7676372b81eccdf5f83f58d2748b302c6cada6a33919309","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/cvzi/ScreenshotTile","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,99,118,122,105,46,115,99,114,101,101,110,115,104,111,116,116,105,108,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,80,77,111,115,102,68,86,71,104,112,69,67,88,119,72,52,121,52,49,86,88,109,102,52,88,105,117,71,95,74,119,88,118,106,118,114,76,118,48,100,95,104,73,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
