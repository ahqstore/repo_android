Additionally, TrackerControl supports custom blocklists.\n\nThis approach\n\n- reveals the companies behind tracking,\n- allows to block tracking selectively, and\n- exposes the purposes of tracking, such as analytics or advertising.\n\nThe app also aims to educate about your rights under Data Protection Law, such the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nUnder the hood, TrackerControl uses Android's VPN functionality, to analyse apps' network communications <i>locally on the Android device</i>. This is accomplished through a local VPN server, to enable network traffic analysis by TrackerControl.\n\nNo root is required, other VPNs or Private DNS are not supported. No external VPN server is used, to keep your data safe! TrackerControl even protects you against <i>DNS cloaking</i>, a popular technique to hide trackers in websites and apps.\n\nTrackerControl will always be free and open source, being a research project.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Oxford HCC","repo":"https://github.com/TrackerControl/tracker-control-android"},"usrVersion":"7171fe9eb4a15e480f766005bddeb6a2b5a2342502e0821f1cebfb841be866d6","version":1766011488,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/TrackerControl/tracker-control-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
