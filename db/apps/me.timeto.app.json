Once you have completed one activity, you have to set a timer for the next one, even if it's a \"sleeping\" activity.\n\nThis time-tracking approach provides real 24/7 data on how long everything takes. You can see it on the Chart screen. It's always surprising.\n\nBy default, the app contains the activities that I use: meditation, work, music, personal development, exercises, walk, getting ready, sleep / rest, other. That's all I need, but you can change it.\n","repo":{"author":"timeto.me","repo":"https://github.com/Medvedev91/timeto.me"},"version":"7fedb31b621f59481bc924aeb2fc80965c29e71494bb998a2f5f29106b83249e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Medvedev91/timeto.me","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,109,101,46,116,105,109,101,116,111,46,97,112,112,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,48,117,99,84,72,77,114,72,66,71,57,87,108,102,117,84,100,50,48,45,56,73,57,122,78,106,98,74,100,85,79,52,111,120,89,116,73,75,118,54,110,104,85,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
