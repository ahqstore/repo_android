This alarm can only be turned off when your room is bright\n<b>Stop Oversleeping with Lux Alarm</b>\n\nTired of hitting snooze and waking up late? Lux Alarm ensures you actually get out of bed by requiring light to silence the alarm.\n\n<b>How it works</b>\n\nTo stop the alarm, you must get up and open your blinds or turn on the light. The app uses your phone's sensor to detect brightness; by the time the alarm turns off, you are already on your feet and ready to start your day.\n\n<b>Key Features</b>\n\n• Smart Light Detection: Uses your phone's sensor to ensure the alarm only deactivates once your environment is bright.\n• Adjustable Sensitivity: Customize the required light level to account for gloomy weather or different room setups.\n• Modern Interface: A clean, intuitive design based on Material Design 3 for easy navigation.\n• Circadian Support: Waking up with light helps regulate your natural sleep cycle and reduces morning grogginess.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/salmundani/LuxAlarm"},"usrVersion":"8924ab828e81712c3381053665fd7aa59361c14694323a010880d8b113261f47","version":1768151858,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/salmundani/LuxAlarm","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
