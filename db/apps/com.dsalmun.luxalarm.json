This alarm can only be turned off when your room is bright\nAre you tired of fighting the snooze button every morning? Do you hit 'dismiss' in a sleepy haze only to wake up late and frantic? It's time to change your relationship with your morning alarm and wake up for real!\n\nWelcome to Lux Alarm, the revolutionary alarm clock designed to get you out of bed by using the one thing you can't ignore: light!\n\nOur app has one simple, powerful rule: the alarm will not stop until your room is filled with light.\n\n☀️ HOW IT WORKS\n\nTo silence the alarm, you have to get up, open the blinds to greet the day, or simply flip on your bedroom light switch. Lux Alarm uses your phone's light sensor to measure the brightness in the room, ensuring you can't cheat your way back to sleep. By the time the alarm is off, you're already on your feet and ready to conquer your day—no more accidental oversleeping!\n\nThis isn't just an alarm; it's a new morning routine. Waking up with light helps to regulate your natural sleep cycle (your circadian rhythm), making you feel more energetic, less groggy, and ready for whatever comes your way.\n\n✨ FEATURES YOU'LL LOVE\n\n💡 Smart Light Detection: The core of our app! The alarm only deactivates when it detects a sufficient level of ambient light. It's your personal sunrise, on command.\n\n🎚️ Adjustable Sensitivity: Is it a dark, rainy morning? No problem! You can customize how much light is needed to turn off the alarm, so it works perfectly for you every single day, in any weather.\n\n🌙 Sleek & Simple Interface: A beautiful, clean, and intuitive design based on Material Design 3 that makes setting your alarm a pleasure. No clutter, no confusion—just the smartest way to wake up.\n\nReady to transform your mornings from a stressful rush into a bright beginning? Stop sleeping in and start living brighter.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/salmundani/LuxAlarm"},"usrVersion":"429da681e5e5a4eba566b3dcd7babeab5075bc9425a27369b3b0eceb7c75792b","version":1767050370,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/salmundani/LuxAlarm","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
