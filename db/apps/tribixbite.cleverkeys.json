Unlike other open-source keyboards, gesture typing works reliably everywhere — including Termux and terminal emulators.\n\n<b>RELIABLE GESTURE TYPING IN TERMUX</b>\nCleverKeys is the only open-source keyboard with stable, production-ready gesture typing that works in Termux. Other keyboards either disable gestures in terminals, produce corrupted output, or remain in alpha/experimental state. CleverKeys works everywhere — terminal emulators, SSH sessions, and developer tools.\n\n<b>NEURAL NETWORK SWIPE ENGINE</b>\n• Custom transformer neural network trained for gesture recognition\n• Sub-100ms predictions with XNNPACK hardware acceleration\n• 100% local processing — works offline, no cloud dependency\n• Tunable beam search (width, length normalization, pruning, early stopping)\n• Open training code and datasets at github.com/tribixbite/CleverKeys-ML\n\n<b>208 CUSTOMIZABLE SHORT-SWIPE GESTURES</b>\n• 8 directions × 26 letter keys = 208 one-touch gestures\n• Per-key customization — assign any action to any direction on any key\n• Navigation: arrow keys, home/end, page up/down\n• Editing: select all, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste\n• Function keys: F1-F12, Escape, Insert, Delete\n• No long-press menus needed\n\n<b>UNLIMITED CLIPBOARD HISTORY</b>\nAs an Input Method Editor, CleverKeys has legitimate clipboard access that other apps lack:\n• Truly unlimited history (configurable by count or storage size)\n• Pin important items for quick access\n• Full-text search through history\n• Persistent across reboots\n• Export/Import for backup\n\n<b>PRIVACY FIRST</b>\n• Zero network permissions — literally cannot phone home\n• No analytics, telemetry, or tracking\n• No cloud sync or data collection\n• All processing on-device\n• Open source = fully auditable\n\n<b>EXTENSIVE THEME ENGINE</b>\n• 18+ built-in themes including Material You (Monet)\n• DIY theme creator with full control over colors\n• Key colors, label colors, border colors, swipe trail effects\n• ePaper, Neon, Everforest, and more styles\n\n<b>100+ KEYBOARD LAYOUTS</b>\n• QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, Dvorak, Colemak\n• Programming layouts with special characters\n• International layouts for 30+ languages\n• Customizable bottom row and modifiers\n\n<b>POWER USER FEATURES</b>\n• Terminal mode with Ctrl/Meta/Fn keys\n• Backup & Restore all settings and custom data\n• Layout profile import/export with gestures included\n\nCleverKeys is a complete Kotlin rewrite of Unexpected Keyboard with neural network gesture typing, clipboard history, and per-key gesture customization added. The ML model architecture, training code, and datasets are all publicly available.\n","repo":{"author":"tribixbite","repo":"https://github.com/tribixbite/CleverKeys"},"usrVersion":"c27589f70817a3c40c5080456a8ed77b54e3bcfc6e0c5e186f1fe27f039ea2f5","version":1768467424,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tribixbite/CleverKeys","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
