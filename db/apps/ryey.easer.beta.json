You can also say it's an event-driven Android automation app. It knows various events, and you, the user and the device owner, can tell it what to do on what event or condition (and even combine multiple events!). Routine actions no longer need to be taken manually.\nMore than that, Easer can not only handle Events, but also check for Conditions. This makes things simpler when they canâ€™t be seens as Events, and makes it more intuitive.\n\nThe development of Easer was inspired by CyanogenMod's 'profile' mechanism and IFTTT. The original intuition was to automatically change the profile on certain time or specific WiFi connections. However, it has been expanded for more general use (so Easer runs on any Android devices).\n\nReminder: Easer is still under development. It may contain bugs and the UI definitely needs to be improved. The [https://renyuneyun.github.io/Easer/en/ website] and [https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer/wiki wiki] has some relevant information and directions, so please read them before using. If you are interested in helping development, please see [https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer/blob/master/README.en.md README] in the repo.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Rui Zhao","repo":"https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer"},"version":"4643967bf8151c065b410dd578ab76f84c8337901b66e334d49c88808e86ddb9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/renyuneyun/Easer","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
