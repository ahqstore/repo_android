The goal of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships by taking turns \"shooting\" at the opponent's board.\n\nThe game offers two game modes:\n- Player vs. Computer\n- Player vs. Player\n\nThe player can choose between 5x5 and 10x10 board sizes and place their ships freely. The number of ships can be selected before the game. Ships of sizes 2 (submarines), 3 (destroyers), 4 (cruisers), and 5 (battleships) are possible.\n\nWhat distinguishes Privacy Friendly Battleship from other similar apps?\n\n1. No Permissions\nPrivacy Friendly Battleship does not require any permissions.\nFor comparison: The top ten similar apps available in the Google Play Store require an average of 6.1 permissions (as of November 2017). These include access to networks, the internet, and location data.\n\n2. No intrusive ads\nMany other free apps in the Google Play Store display intrusive ads, which, among other things, can shorten battery life and consume data.\n\nThe app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
