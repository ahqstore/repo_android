Please do not use it for medical purposes !\n\nThis utility works by covering the flash as well as the device's camera with a finger, and waiting for 10 seconds. It works best when the person stays still, and the environment is dark. \n\nThe phone analyzes the amount of red captured by the camera, and attempts to calculate the heart rate based on the subtle changes it detects.\n\nDuring the measurement, the application shows the current calculation results, and shows the captured data on a line chart.\n\nOnce completed, the following further details are shown:\n<ul>\n<li>Standardized values, along with their timestamp (the values are scaled between 0 and 1, and a rolling average is applied for smoothing)</li>\n<li>Timings where a new heart beat is detected.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThese data can be shared with other application in order to be exported.\n","repo":{"author":"Bálint Erdősi","repo":"https://github.com/berdosi/HeartBeat"},"version":"39a4a5ee296054d1b58c3b9cc3bf4c8e4b59bbd210ac49b7bcb1aea0d64fc0da","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/berdosi/HeartBeat","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,101,117,46,98,101,114,100,111,115,105,46,97,112,112,46,104,101,97,114,116,98,101,97,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,119,68,110,48,48,106,97,114,52,102,107,67,100,80,83,98,110,112,51,106,107,49,84,45,49,66,88,53,48,109,122,89,69,105,112,82,101,98,82,73,50,89,85,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
