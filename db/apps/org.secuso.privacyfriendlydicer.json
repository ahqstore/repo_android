Minimum amount of permissions:\nThe \"VIBRATE\" permission (category “Other”) is required to provide the vibration feedback.\nMost of dicing apps in the Google Play Store require additional permissions, the top ten requires an average of 2,9 permissions (June 2016). Those are e.g. accessing the network or Internet which is mostly used to display advertisement. Some apps have access to GPS or telephony data.\n\n2. No advertisement:\nMany other apps in the Google Play Store display advertisement and therefore might violate the user’s privacy, shorten battery life or usage mobile data.\n\n\nFeel free to contact us via:\nBluesky - @secusoresearch.bsky.social https://bsky.app/profile/secusoresearch.bsky.social\nMastodon - @SECUSO_Research@bawü.social https://xn--baw-joa.social/@SECUSO_Research/\nJob opening - https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/english/Job_Offers.php","repo":{"author":"SECUSO - Security Usability Society","repo":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-dicer"},"version":"d8f31dc6832e38c4e2b47477ccc32044fb4e0cfff41d0c246275c048b19f15d9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-dicer","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
