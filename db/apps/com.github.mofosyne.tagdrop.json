This is unlike current usage of QR\ncodes, where it is normally used to just store plaintext or urls or contacts.\n\n1. First objective is to decode data URIs sent in via intent from a scanner like\nhttps://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.zxing.client.android or from a NFC tag reader.\n\n2. Secondary objective, is that for larger files, you want to spread it over\nmultiple QR codes. So we'll need a way to read all these tags an then join it\ntogether.\n\nOnly the first part is done at the moment.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/mofosyne/tagdrop"},"version":"ea78dab9518cbd77c9ba3ae57480e9b58805da453125d717e92dca10f79c8714","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mofosyne/tagdrop","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,109,111,102,111,115,121,110,101,46,116,97,103,100,114,111,112,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
