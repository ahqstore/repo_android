The leftmost icon is Copy. Tapping it puts the place's coordinates in your clipboard for pasting into a calendar event, sending to a friend, etc. The middle icon is Share and opens Android's Share Sheet so you can send the place's name, address, and coordinates to other apps or contacts. The rightmost icon is Open. Tapping it opens the coordinates in any installed app that knows how to handle geo: Intent URIs. That includes e.g. Organic Maps, OsmAnd, Google Maps, Waze, and more.\n\nYou can use your own self-hosted https://git.sr.ht/~amolith/adresilo-server/ or buy codes to use our hosted server at https://adresilo.com\n","repo":{"author":"MBOA","repo":"https://git.sr.ht/~amolith/adresilo"},"version":"ad293e55f54503583641d596a0ebef86541c00937c5c78dcd1046d24b06b1441","site":null,"source":"https://git.sr.ht/~amolith/adresilo","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,97,100,114,101,115,105,108,111,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,45,45,95,87,51,81,84,83,53,70,102,57,50,76,103,48,90,66,85,115,97,79,68,98,73,113,86,65,53,57,88,50,109,113,66,78,105,111,68,99,120,57,73,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
