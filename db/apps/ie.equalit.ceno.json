It uses peer-to-peer technology to deliver websites to your phone and caches popular content with cooperating peers. Ceno can be used to bypass Internet censorship and help others retrieve blocked pages.\n\nSay NO to censorship! Install Ceno Browser today and be prepared for the next time you get 🔌 unplugged. \n\n🚫🌴 <strong>Resilient.</strong>\nCeno is designed with internet shutdown scenarios in mind. Websites are shared by a global network of peers, and stored in a distributed cache for availability when traditional networks are blocked or go down.\n\n🔓👀 <strong>Unlock the web.</strong>\nAccess any website. Frequently requested content is cached on the network  and cannot be forcibly removed. \n\n💲🌐 <strong>Reduce Data Costs.</strong>\nBy routing user traffic through peer-to-peer networks, Ceno Browser incurs less data costs while still providing users with circumvention capability.\n\n📖👐  <strong>Free and open source.</strong>\nCeno Browser is powered by Ouinet, an open source library enabling third party developers to incorporate the Ceno network into their apps for peer-to-peer connectivity.\n\n<strong>Important:</strong> Ceno has two modes of operation - public and personal. You can easily toggle between them. Public mode offers the best connectivity but the least privacy - websites that you visit or share are recorded in a publicly accessible registry (BitTorrent). Private mode eliminates this record but may be slower and less efficient at retrieving content. <strong>See the <a href=\"https://censorship.no/user-manual\">User Manual</a> for more details on Ceno usage. </strong>\n\n<strong>About eQualit.ie</strong>\neQualit.ie develops open and reusable systems with a focus on privacy, online security, and information management. Our goal is to create accessible technology and improve the skill-set needed for defending human rights and freedoms in the digital age.\n\nTo learn more about Ceno Browser and its distributed library, Ouinet, please visit https://censorship.no\n\n<strong>Questions / Need support?</strong>\nRead more in the <a href=\"https://censorship.no/user-manual/en/\">Ceno User Manual</a>,  or contact us at support@censorship.no. We love receiving feedback and are continuously improving Ceno for its users!\n\nStay connected, and help keep the web open and accessible to all!\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/censorship-no/ceno-browser"},"version":"33d6ee1b22421fb30216de31e50ee13926d1403457eda0e54101589e4885ad7d","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/censorship-no/ceno-browser","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,101,46,101,113,117,97,108,105,116,46,99,101,110,111,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,73,85,68,110,51,74,107,115,79,82,74,76,122,81,65,49,78,105,89,66,109,118,71,55,77,103,104,78,88,114,122,48,88,52,76,106,88,45,107,117,70,57,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
