Due to its presence in popular culture, Morse code has been featured in movies, games, and other medias as a simple way to encode messages, inspiring fans to research and explore the language as part of fun, puzzle-solving activities. This makes it useful even in cryptography or cryptogram events as a handy encoding tool.\n\n1.\tTell others when you are in a dangerous situation (SOS).\n2.\tHide your secret number or password via dots and dashes.\n3.\tCipher or decipher hidden clues in games.\n4.\tLearn cryptography or cryptogram through learning Morse codes.\n5.\tBecome a codebreaker by breaking secret codes in real time translation.\n6.  Create a secret number.\n+   Many more \n\n---\nIt really helps to leave a review or to star the project in the source code repsitory, and it means the world to us.\nIf you have problems using the app, please write an e-mail or open an issue on GitHub.\nResponses are most often immediate, and bugs are fixed as soon as possible. \n","repo":{"author":"Crazy Marvin & Contributors","repo":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Morse"},"usrVersion":"67c52d2f143e13d27cfe7dc88bb3ef0683c99f850ef93ab2e4fd34b5d65c08f3","version":1766180396,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Morse","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
