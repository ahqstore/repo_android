Create a secret number.\n+   Many more \n\n---\nIt really helps to leave a review or to star the project in the source code repsitory, and it means the world to us.\nIf you have problems using the app, please write an e-mail or open an issue on GitHub.\nResponses are most often immediate, and bugs are fixed as soon as possible. \n","repo":{"author":"Crazy Marvin & Contributors","repo":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Morse"},"version":"a703be04bce5e51a9d54946c4337605579c9dda699cf0ee085620c58c4890276","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Morse","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
