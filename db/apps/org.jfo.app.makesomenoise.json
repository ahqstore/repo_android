You can virtually\nwhip your friend, or make fun of them. You can play the Dun Dun Duuun or Suspense sound when\nsomeone is down during a murder party :-) . Did you see The Big Bang Theory episode\nwhen they whip each other or play a murder party ? The sounds are almost the same, and\nyou can use the app like they do it on the show.\n\nHelp :\nPush a button, and the sound is played. Quite simple :-) !\nThe bottom button with the icon repeat the last played sound.\nYou can also use the keyboard (Key 1 to 5, and R for repeating the last sound).\nThe last sound is also played when you do a whip move with your phone.\n\nThe sounds can't be changed (it will come in a future version).\n\nSounds are made by myself, or came from Simon Lacelle (see freesound.org) or from Dick De Benedictis.\nAll of them are open and free to use.\n","repo":{"author":"J.FORESTIER","repo":"https://github.com/psa-jforestier/makesomenoise"},"version":"314b8218f21954e5b0019ca46fb5458400f47106e920607d5130adfbe5d20688","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/psa-jforestier/makesomenoise","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,106,102,111,46,97,112,112,46,109,97,107,101,115,111,109,101,110,111,105,115,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,117,106,107,120,49,111,56,76,103,52,75,54,97,104,57,104,45,78,53,107,116,89,79,49,88,72,80,105,110,99,90,74,85,106,51,105,69,89,112,80,88,71,81,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
