This allows the phone to be positioned in the same location and orientation as when the original picture was taken.  \n\nCurrently I use this app as a quick way to align the antennas for my software defined radios with a fixed point, but there can be other uses as well.  \n\nThis app also has the capability to select a certain color to be transparent for \"green screen\" style overlays.  The transparency can be applied to the image or the live camera preview.  \n\nThis app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.  \n\nSource code is available on GitHub: JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign  \n\nThe source code is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.  \n\nThe app icon was created with Stable Diffusion.\n\n","repo":{"author":"JS Hobby Soft","repo":"https://github.com/JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign"},"version":"857c5fab6fb61c2a4f026082f2901931a666d36d16f8e05902424df542b190fa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JS-HobbySoft/CameraAlign","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,106,115,104,111,98,98,121,115,111,102,116,46,99,97,109,101,114,97,97,108,105,103,110,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,86,109,84,68,97,72,76,90,105,50,67,107,89,122,116,51,76,97,68,75,45,75,88,74,67,79,65,120,76,80,119,99,82,80,73,117,56,86,70,88,75,114,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
