Voice can be coded with Opus, AMR, Codec2, G.729, G.722, G.722.1, G.726, or PCMU/PCMA codecs. Security is achieved via TLS or WSS SIP signaling transport and ZRTP or (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.\n\nDevelopment of baresip app is motivated by need for a secure, open source SIP based VoIP User Agent for Android that does not depend on proprietary, third party push notification services.\n\nIf you need video calling and have a device with Android version 9 or newer that supports Camera2 API at hardware Support Level LEVEL3 or FULL, you can instead of this application install its sister application baresip+.\n\nSource code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio\">GitHub</a>, where also issues can be reported.\n","repo":{"author":"Juha Heinanen","repo":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio"},"usrVersion":"a492346bc02d64c79989d324533ec6b574e9273c698c57ebf73d506a848672b8","version":1760372576,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
