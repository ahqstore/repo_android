Voice can be coded with Opus, AMR, Codec2, G.729, G.722, G.722.1, G.726, or PCMU/PCMA codecs. Security is achieved via TLS or WSS SIP signaling transport and ZRTP or (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.\n\nDevelopment of baresip app is motivated by need for a secure, open source SIP based VoIP User Agent for Android that does not depend on proprietary, third party push notification services.\n\nIf you need video calling, you can instead of this application install its sister application baresip+.\n\nSource code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio\">GitHub</a>, where also issues can be reported.\n","repo":{"author":"Juha Heinanen","repo":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio"},"usrVersion":"3c19492b89c2e0d759140545752551ba2475ffb40bdc60c8907599674bd6d3c9","version":1769977598,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/juha-h/baresip-studio","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
