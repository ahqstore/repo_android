When you align\n3 or more in a row, all adjacents sprites of the shape & color vanish.\n\nYou can only swap adjacent sprites vertically or horizontally. You can swap\nsprites even if it won't result in a 3-or-more alignment, but that will cost you\n10% of your current score.\n\nThe game offers two variations on the gameplay and manages a list of current\ngames, that you can pause and recall at any time.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://code.google.com/p/asqare/source"},"version":"13d8ff3d8ea2facf3d8bb0f868103263b872df78bbbbeefe5f17c8ad1d35e042","site":null,"source":"https://code.google.com/p/asqare/source","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,97,108,102,114,97,121,46,97,115,113,97,114,101,46,49,48,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
