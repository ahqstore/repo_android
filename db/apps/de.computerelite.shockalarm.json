It allows you to fully manage your shockers, logs, shares, hubs, and share links.\n\nThere is advanced functionaity like controling multiple shockers at the same time and specifying a random interval for intensity, duration and a delay (if you're into that).\n\nIt's fully material you themed just like the standard Android apps you're already used to and provides a responsive ui with a nice design.\n\nFurthermore it fixes some layout flaws of the official OpenShock Frontend like having shared and own shockers in seperate tabs (which is annoying). On top it also has lots of info buttons you can press to get more insight on what something does.\n\nThis app uses https://openshock.app/ by default but self hosted instances can be used as well.","repo":{"author":"ComputerElite","repo":"https://github.com/ComputerElite/ShockAlarmApp.git"},"version":"bdac92e8f75fd3ddf633286a2e51ddfb5e589cd9f69fd27e0935ed406f300027","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ComputerElite/ShockAlarmApp.git","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,99,111,109,112,117,116,101,114,101,108,105,116,101,46,115,104,111,99,107,97,108,97,114,109,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,122,109,114,55,70,71,111,112,102,102,48,53,108,53,122,85,57,54,57,119,53,85,121,70,108,107,90,113,120,75,65,106,79,80,83,116,52,106,81,82,108,54,85,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
