Play old‑school pixel games, explore vintage software, or enjoy new creations built in the iconic 80s style — all with the convenience and power of today’s hardware. Whether you're reliving childhood favorites or discovering retro computing for the first time, 8‑Bit Wonders delivers an authentic yet modernized experience.\n\nThe app supports a wide range of classic Commodore 8‑bit computers: C64, VIC‑20, PET, C128, Plus/4, and C16. It runs smoothly on phones, tablets, and Android TVs, offering broad compatibility across modern devices.\n\nYou can use hardware joysticks, gamepads, mice, a virtual touch joystick, and both hardware and virtual keyboards with customizable layouts. Save states and a built‑in time‑machine feature let you rewind gameplay and undo mistakes at any moment. For an authentic retro look, CRT emulation recreates the feel of classic displays.\n\nAll disk and tape formats supported by VICE are fully compatible. The app includes an initial library of systems and preinstalled games, and you can expand it by adding your own save states, downloading content directly from archive.org, or importing additional games and applications as 8bw or rp9 files, including those created with tools like C64 Forever.\n\nYou can customize your controls by mapping buttons to keystrokes or enabling auto‑fire. A dedicated demo mode lets you play audio in the background or run visual demos in a clean movie‑screen view without Android UI elements.\n\n8‑Bit Wonders is still in development, and your feedback helps shape its future.
