The good thing is that when you modify your settings through its Shared Preferences, you won't lose all your settings once the Developer Options are modified.\nWith Shizuku, you can grant this app with <i>android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</i> in order for it to modify your Settings values.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/JackEblan/Geto"},"version":"c6ddf8d2670e79d04054a98ce51fea5b059deae5f6973278b63cd2bde7e4c57d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/JackEblan/Geto","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,103,101,116,111,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,112,105,98,102,68,90,101,111,75,120,97,118,105,107,108,71,85,49,89,68,95,67,117,109,55,53,74,87,55,78,56,72,102,55,67,101,102,86,83,102,55,53,119,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
