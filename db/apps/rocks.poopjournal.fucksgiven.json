Whenever something happens that you needlessly concern yourself with, jot it down with a tap. The app creates a chart of how many fucks you’ve given, so you can work to give none.\n \nFucks Given allows you to back up your data and has a beautiful dark mode that can turn on automatically, following the system theme. It even works on your smartwatch.\n\nWebpage: <a href=\"https://www.crazymarvin.com/fucks-given\">https://www.crazymarvin.com/fucks-given</a>\nTranslate Fucks Given: <a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/fucksgiven/\">https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/fucks-given/</a> \nSource on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/FucksGiven\">https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/FucksGiven</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Crazy Marvin & Contributors","repo":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/FucksGiven"},"version":"64e635597fc4be22323a898fc71bae1a5bb8c9492b47bae55100ec2ff1850026","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/FucksGiven","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,114,111,99,107,115,46,112,111,111,112,106,111,117,114,110,97,108,46,102,117,99,107,115,103,105,118,101,110,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,89,67,73,119,75,98,51,109,80,71,109,77,99,100,109,54,103,68,118,107,102,70,67,55,119,121,76,54,87,110,55,111,120,118,74,90,84,87,109,85,116,87,65,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
