Simply confirm the download.\n* Check the \"Auto-update database\" checkbox in the menu (recommended) to automatically receive daily DB updates (these are incremental/delta updates, so they consume very little traffic).\n* Check the \"Block by rating\" checkbox to block calls with negative rating automatically.\n* You can also check the \"Use contacts\" checkbox if you want your contacts not to be treated as unknown callers.\n* After these steps everything should just work (but you can always find more options in Settings). Enjoy!\n\nSee <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/-/blob/master/FAQ.md\">frequently asked questions</a> to learn more.\n\nThe main phone number database is downloaded from <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker_data\">a gitlab repository</a>.\n<b>Database updates and detailed review queries are performed using 3rd-party servers.</b>\nNo user-identifiable information is sent (except for the phone number\nthe detailed reviews are loaded for).\n\nYet Another Call Blocker is still under development. Any help is welcome.\n\n''NonFreeNet:'' the 3rd-party service is not open source.\n","repo":{"author":"Xynngh","repo":"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/tree/HEAD"},"version":"6a6b8249d777c69b1a31338fc74ae48a6b47dfd874c40a893587c17a932baea3","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
