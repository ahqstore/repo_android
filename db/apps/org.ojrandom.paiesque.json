It calculates a <strong>personalized activity score</strong> and monitors your <strong>Resting Heart Rate</strong>, giving you clear, actionable insights into your fitness progress—all on your device, with no subscriptions or data sharing.</p><p><b>Prerequisite</b> To get started, you must first install and configure <b>Gadgetbridge</b> to collect heart rate data from your compatible fitness tracker or smartwatch.</p><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p> <p>PAIesque is inspired by public research from the <a href=\"https://www.ntnu.edu/cerg\">NTNU Cardiac Exercise Research Group (CERG)</a>. Their foundational studies on the PAI (Personal Activity Intelligence) metric demonstrates a powerful finding: \"Our <strong>research</strong> shows that those who achieve <strong>100 PAI</strong> or more every week over time <strong>live on average eight years longer</strong> than others.\"</p> <p>While PAIesque does <b>NOT</b> use the official <strong>PAI®</strong> algorithm (that is not known anyway), it applies this same, powerful principle: <strong>Your score rises faster when your heart works harder</strong> - so long both brisk walks and vigorous workouts move you toward your goal.</p><p><strong>Key Differentiators:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Open &amp; Transparent:</strong> Unlike “black box” scores, every calculation is based on the disclosed <a href=\"https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/karvonen-formula\">Karvonen Heart Rate Reserve</a> (HRR) method in combination with a simplified <a href=\"https://www.firstbeat.com/en/blog/what-is-trimp\">Training Impulse Calculation</a> (TRIMP). You always know how your score is determined.</li> <li><strong>Universal &amp; Consistent:</strong> Use it with almost any fitness tracker supported by <a href=\"https://gadgetbridge.org/\">Gadgetbridge</a> (Amazfit, Garmin, Xiaomi, Fitbit, 100+ devices). <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/ojrandom/paiesque/wiki/Why-a-Consistent-Standard-Matters\">Your scoring method stays the same</a> even if you change devices.</li> <li><strong>Privacy-First &amp; Local:</strong> Everything is processed on your phone. Your heart rate data never leaves your device, and no internet connection or account is required.</li> </ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is an independent, community-developed application. It is based on public scientific principles and foundational exercise physiology methods but is <strong>not affiliated with or endorsed by NTNU CERG</strong>, and its score is distinct from the proprietary <strong>Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI®)</strong> metric.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"OJ Random","repo":"https://codeberg.org/ojrandom/paiesque"},"usrVersion":"d075af9fc6a66e83ff877b0b5e6ee186547cccdf3b2489e4daa5577c52fafaa9","version":1767979454,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/ojrandom/paiesque","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
