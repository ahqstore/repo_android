This can provide more accurate location\nthan the build-in receiver (very useful for tracking in dense areas or in the\nwoods, esp. for small tracks or streetaddresses etc), as well as make it\npossible to use GPS inside a car/boot, where the GPS receiver is mounted outside\nto get better reception.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://sourceforge.net/p/bluegps4droid/git"},"version":"cb081d1094b3dff37e85992b48b1e2e2dff23b340afc30bc05386bdd63b75205","site":null,"source":"https://sourceforge.net/p/bluegps4droid/git","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
