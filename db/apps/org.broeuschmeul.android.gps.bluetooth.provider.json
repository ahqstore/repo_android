This can provide more accurate location\nthan the build-in receiver (very useful for tracking in dense areas or in the\nwoods, esp. for small tracks or streetaddresses etc), as well as make it\npossible to use GPS inside a car/boot, where the GPS receiver is mounted outside\nto get better reception.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://sourceforge.net/p/bluegps4droid/git"},"version":"cb081d1094b3dff37e85992b48b1e2e2dff23b340afc30bc05386bdd63b75205","site":null,"source":"https://sourceforge.net/p/bluegps4droid/git","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,98,114,111,101,117,115,99,104,109,101,117,108,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,103,112,115,46,98,108,117,101,116,111,111,116,104,46,112,114,111,118,105,100,101,114,46,49,50,54,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
