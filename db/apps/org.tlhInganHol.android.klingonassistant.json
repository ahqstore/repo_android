It can parse Klingon grammar and serve as an aid in Klingon-to-English translation. However, it is NOT a general-purpose English-to-Klingon translator. You will need to know some Klingon already to make use of it for that purpose.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-android"},"version":"980b8091be9b92d5f4a513bd04fa98ad868574b68e09ff42af5ca9091aa2d7fb","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/De7vID/klingon-assistant-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
