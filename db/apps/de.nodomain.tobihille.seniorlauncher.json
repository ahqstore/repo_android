(911 and 112 for calling the ambulance is translated of course)\n\nWhy is MMS used for images?\n* Because it is available everywhere and every phone has an app installed that can use it\n* Because it is the only way (that I found out) to direct the user right to the newest images\n\nI recommend the use of https://f-droid.org/packages/com.moez.QKSMS as a SMS/MMS app because it\ncopies all images automatically to the gallery and because it's free.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/tobihille/SeniorLauncher"},"version":"1e3ace3adf7b84dea0a0a7d9c1d63e94a26c68cca74832828164b1e935e08eff","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tobihille/SeniorLauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,110,111,100,111,109,97,105,110,46,116,111,98,105,104,105,108,108,101,46,115,101,110,105,111,114,108,97,117,110,99,104,101,114,46,55,48,48,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
