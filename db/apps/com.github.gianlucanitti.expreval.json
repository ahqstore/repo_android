Main features:\n\n* Supports variables (e.g. you can do \"a=5\", then \"a+1\" and you get 6)\n* Built-in basic function (like logarithms and trigonometry)\n* Custom functions can be defined (e.g. \"log(x,b)=log(x)/log(b)\", then log(32,2) will print 5)\n* Variables and functions can be edited both from the prompt and dialogs\n* Can print parsing and evaluation steps.\n* (Android 6.0+ only) can evaluate expressions from text selection in any application (ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT intent).\n* Fully localizable - actually includes English and Italian, you can contribute yor translation with a pull request on GitHub.\n\nChangelog:\n\n* 1.2: updated build tools to fix crash on some Android versions.\n* 1.1: added localization support and Italian translation; added ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT intent filter.\n* 1.0: Initial version.\n\nThis application is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/java-expr-eval\">this</a> open source (MIT licensed) library.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/android-expr-eval"},"version":"39d681ca959f7b8b4d2c14dddfc5818169a6974f83b8691effc967b4ca0d4ba9","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/gianluca-nitti/android-expr-eval","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,103,105,97,110,108,117,99,97,110,105,116,116,105,46,101,120,112,114,101,118,97,108,46,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
