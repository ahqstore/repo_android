Scan the barcode given on the screen (the app\nremembers the unique id at the end of the url so that it can identify your\nrequests for web pages). Choose Open in Browser and choose Send to Computer (you\nmay have to scroll). You are now setup and can send webpages to your computer\nvia the browser share menu. The computer browser checks every two minutes for\nrequests so you might have to wait a little. The source code is also available\nfor the server side of things.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/IvanVolosyuk/share-to-browser"},"version":"937ea34e29e75f7af4dbb570258f6074a11d887ff7f8665a14a255e78d7ec33e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/IvanVolosyuk/share-to-browser","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,105,118,97,110,118,111,108,111,115,121,117,107,46,115,104,97,114,101,116,111,98,114,111,119,115,101,114,46,55,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
