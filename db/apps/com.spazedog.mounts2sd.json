The content\nmanagement is able to move a lot more different content between /data and\n/sd-ext, including the new internal storage, which on newer devices, is placed\nin /data/media, and it also contains more than one option for storing system\ncontent on both /data and /sd-ext.\n\nRequires root.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/SpazeDog/mounts2sd"},"version":"f307353628465f829fa9ffff9c757fa65a8001c5e341d94ec707b8a166e88bea","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SpazeDog/mounts2sd","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,115,112,97,122,101,100,111,103,46,109,111,117,110,116,115,50,115,100,46,51,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
