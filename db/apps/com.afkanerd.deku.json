With Deku SMS, you can seamlessly send and receive end-to-end encrypted SMS messages, ensuring that your conversations remain confidential.\n\nOne of the standout features of Deku SMS is its ability to send images over SMS.

This convenient feature ensures that you can access your messages even when you're away from your device, providing you with greater flexibility and convenience in managing your conversations.\n\nKey Features:\n- End-to-end encryption: Protect your SMS conversations with robust encryption, giving you peace of mind that your messages are secure.\n- Image sharing: Easily send and receive images over SMS, making your conversations more engaging and expressive.\n- Message forwarding: Configure the app to forward your SMS messages to your online servers, allowing you to access your messages from any device.\n\nDeku SMS is an open-source project, and we believe in the power of community collaboration.
