All tool information is processed automatically from a public GitHub repository,\n  validated, and stored locally on your device. Once synced, the local database becomes the single source of truth,\n  ensuring fast access even when offline.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Key features</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Browse and search curated Termux tools by category</li>\n  <li>View detailed tool information, installation commands, and repositories</li>\n  <li>Daily updates of GitHub star counts and README content (00:00 UTC)</li>\n  <li>Offline-first design with local Room database storage</li>\n  <li>No trackers, no analytics, no ads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>\n  Termux Hub fetches static metadata from GitHub and processes tool data, star counts,\n  and README files independently. All validated data is stored in a local Room database.\n  If syncing fails, the app safely falls back to cached or bundled data.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Data sources</h2>\n<p>\n  All data is <strong>read-only</strong> and sourced from the public\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/maazm7d/TermuxHub\">TermuxHub GitHub repository</a>.\n  This includes tool metadata, repositories, thumbnails, GitHub stars, READMEs,\n  and Hall of Fame entries.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Privacy</h2>\n<p>\n  Termux Hub does not collect personal data, does not require accounts,\n  and does not include tracking, analytics, or advertising libraries.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Contributing</h2>\n<p>\n  Anyone can help improve the catalog.
