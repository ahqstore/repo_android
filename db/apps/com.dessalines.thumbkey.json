Its easy to learn, and designed for fast typing speeds.\n\nInstead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses <b>large keys with predictable positions</b>, to prevent your eyes from hunting and pecking for letters.\n\nAs the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of touch-typing, your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.\n\nThis project is a follow-up to the now unmaintained (and closed-source) <a href=\"https://www.exideas.com/ME/\">MessagEase Keyboard</a>, which is its main inspiration.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key"},"version":"d4225cce5450f372f39471a7a2a6de633a16da62536380aea43c30243362cec5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,100,101,115,115,97,108,105,110,101,115,46,116,104,117,109,98,107,101,121,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,119,55,97,120,116,105,74,103,85,53,105,108,70,72,102,90,100,79,52,74,48,109,81,51,97,53,71,68,118,119,56,54,76,65,48,53,77,115,112,105,88,53,119,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
