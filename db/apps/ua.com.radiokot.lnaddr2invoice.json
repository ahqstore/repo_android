Here's how it is done:\n\nClicking an address\nSometimes, a Lightning address is a clickable link, just like an email. When you click it, LN Address to Invoice appears.\n\nSelecting an address\nOften a Lightning address is just a text. In this case, select it and in the appeared system menu look for the \"Send sats\" action.\n\nCopy-pasting an address\nIf you see a Lightning address which is neither clickable nor selectable, or the presenting app doesn't support selection actions, just copy the address from there and paste into LN Address to Invoice with the Paste button in the header of the intro screen, or with the \"Paste address\" launcher icon shortcut.\n","repo":{"author":"Oleg Koretsky","repo":"https://github.com/Radiokot/ln-addr-to-invoice"},"version":"434ffad96d9ecf69a85905572ced173d47219d2031be0e4ffd52bd2890106d84","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Radiokot/ln-addr-to-invoice","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,117,97,46,99,111,109,46,114,97,100,105,111,107,111,116,46,108,110,97,100,100,114,50,105,110,118,111,105,99,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,69,56,102,48,73,116,68,70,101,75,73,75,70,53,78,100,78,108,57,86,67,113,69,122,97,111,110,98,56,103,50,82,69,119,55,105,57,71,56,115,65,68,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
