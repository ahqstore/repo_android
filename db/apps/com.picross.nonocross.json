The game is known by many names Nonograms, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Hanjie and various others.\n\n- Modes\nThere are two game modes. You can either practice on a pre-made grid, or you can play a randomly generated grid with custom parameters.\n\n- How to play\nThe game is relatively simple, the number in each row/column corresponds to the number of filled cells in that row/column. So '3 5' at the beginning of a column means there is a block of 3 cell and a block of 5 cell in that column which are not touching. Once you have the grid in front of you it will all make sense\n\n- Notes\nThe camera permission is used to share puzzles using QR codes\nNonograms are also known by many other names, including Paint by Numbers, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Picross, Picma, PrismaPixels, Pixel Puzzles, Crucipixel, Edel, FigurePic, Hanjie, HeroGlyphix, Illust-Logic, Japanese Crosswords, Japanese Puzzles, Kare Karala!, Logic Art, Logic Square, Logicolor, Logik-Puzzles, Logimage, Oekaki Logic, Oekaki-Mate, Paint Logic, Picture Logic, Tsunamii, Paint by Sudoku and Binary Coloring Books\n","repo":{"author":"Jared Forrest","repo":"https://github.com/jaredforrest/nonocross"},"version":"04c2a48e0e69f1071d91e4659b0cb05c0d57c2158e59a645015bdc63e4012af5","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jaredforrest/nonocross","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,112,105,99,114,111,115,115,46,110,111,110,111,99,114,111,115,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,122,79,95,90,80,119,88,85,81,104,71,98,67,121,51,102,71,90,104,87,95,106,112,68,88,53,103,99,117,114,107,78,68,109,52,82,81,65,112,80,56,99,65,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
