The measurements help map the extent of mobile phone network coverage. You can use the app to collect data for personal purposes and export them to various files.\n\nSome features:\n• specially optimized GPS parameters to reduce battery drain\n• upload to OpenCellID.org and BeaconDB projects\n• export to SD card as CSV, JSON, GPX, KML and KMZ.\n• ad-free, forever!\n\nThe OpenCellID.org project goal is to create a worldwide open source database of mobile cell locations. Tower Collector gives you opportunity to contribute in OpenCellID project by uploading cell towers locations from your area. Collected data can be used to quickly locate devices without enabling GPS.\n\nBeaconDB is an a public database that collects location information about common wireless infrastructure (cell towers, WiFi access points, Bluetooth beacons). The cell tower data you contribute will be aggregated and released to the public under the \"Creative Commons (CC-0)\" license.\n\nPlease help me translate it to other languages, visit https://i18n.zamojski.feedback/\n\nThis application does not collect, store or send any information which can be used to directly identify user, device which is being used or any other personal information.\n\nBUG REPORTS AND FEATURE REQUEST VIA EMAIL OR GITHUB ISSUES PLEASE.","repo":{"author":"Adam Zamojski","repo":"https://github.com/zamojski/TowerCollector"},"version":"2d7dbd5fdd409e4e7c8f1da99744a8384e417389127fafb0c5410e9caa7576f4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/zamojski/TowerCollector","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,110,102,111,46,122,97,109,111,106,115,107,105,46,115,111,102,116,46,116,111,119,101,114,99,111,108,108,101,99,116,111,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,103,120,98,70,89,86,98,57,95,114,79,102,118,104,87,68,102,77,98,49,90,104,107,66,70,122,81,57,53,114,122,45,87,73,75,45,56,86,87,83,72,90,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
