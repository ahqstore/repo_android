It merely collects data for later analysis by a qualified\nprofessional instead of using paper forms or notebooks. All data is stored\nlocally on your Android device, and only event duration and score is stored.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://sourceforge.net/p/migrainetracker/code"},"version":"89370f8c4a070943e644a1f6f4fd86a2ea581796257c1b2aac3eaadae3b1ca24","site":null,"source":"https://sourceforge.net/p/migrainetracker/code","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,114,104,105,97,110,110,111,110,119,101,98,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,109,105,103,114,97,105,110,101,116,114,97,99,107,101,114,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
