You can validate if system services have correct error handling or transfer binder objects / tokens of other services in order to validate if the target system service validates binder arguments.\n\nThis Project covers following features:\n\n* Browse managers and binder interfaces.\n* Execute Fuzzy tasks\n* Configure argument lists for each parameter of the method to fuzz\n* Read logs of recent tasks\n* Use python3 cli (optional) to execute fuzzer from desktop.\n* Define fuzzer script and execute via cli\n\nEnjoy our App!","repo":{"author":"ChickenHook","repo":"https://github.com/ChickenHook/BinderFuzzy"},"version":"1d21b8068bacd2067d359dbf2b22150ac3402ee45bee58f5c172a519ba2cc2b1","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ChickenHook/BinderFuzzy","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,99,104,105,99,107,101,110,104,111,111,107,46,98,105,110,100,101,114,102,117,122,122,121,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,71,106,87,72,82,111,73,69,98,76,117,45,73,111,86,49,104,116,49,81,65,115,52,45,74,118,97,120,86,76,110,76,52,113,120,104,52,88,121,75,98,95,73,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
