Replay a completed game with the exact same tasks to compare scores with friends.\n2. Start a new game with preset settings for a fair and fresh challenge for everyone.\n\nDifficulty Calculation\nTask difficulty is determined using algorithms based on column addition, column subtraction, long multiplication, and long division, creating realistic and well-balanced exercises.\n\nDetailed Results\nAfter each game, view a detailed summary that includes your selected settings, your performance (accuracy, speed, and score), and a complete list of all your tasks and answers for review.\n\nPersonal Leaderboard\nYour top 10 results are displayed separately for each combination of settings, allowing you to easily track your progress.
