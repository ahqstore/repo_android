Trippy.\nDid you ever wonder what the world looks like through a \nholomorphic function? \n\nNo? Wondering what a 'holomorphic function' is in the first place? \n\nDon't worry! You don't need to know any of this to use the app. \nJust touch the screen and see the math at work! \n\nThe Poleidoscope shows a rectangular domain of the plane of complex numbers. \nThe user sets up roots and poles of a rational function on the screen \nand this function is then used to deflect the live camera picture. \n\nHolomorphic functions are examples of so-called 'conformal mappings' which \nare prominently featured in the works of contemporary artists such \nas M.C. Escher. The Poleidoscope provides a live experience of similar \npictures. \n\nFor those more involved in mathematics the app is a way to visualize \ncomplex polynomials and rational functions and give a feeling for \nseveral topics in complex analysis such as differentials of holomorphic \nfunctions, Rouche's theorem, ramifications, local normal forms, etc. \n","repo":{"author":"Bowl","repo":"https://gitlab.com/bowl1/poleidoscope"},"version":"f514b3b65dd5f6e2815262cf97e115908000fe2d23939306d4b6b237b39a5776","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/bowl1/poleidoscope","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,46,112,111,108,101,105,100,111,115,99,111,112,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,66,97,113,53,51,88,82,73,104,83,85,68,80,52,45,82,118,56,71,50,52,73,89,99,120,73,102,50,56,108,83,84,95,117,77,95,112,76,66,79,56,101,103,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
