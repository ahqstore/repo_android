This allows you to store files in encrypted vaults that other apps can't decrypt.\nCurrently, DroidFS supports the following encrypted containers:\n- gocryptfs (https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs): encrypts file contents and file names but doesn't hide directory structure or file sizes.\n- CryFS (https://github.com/cryfs/cryfs): slower, but encrypts everything and obfuscates file sizes.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n- Compatible with original encrypted volume implementations\n- Internal support for video, audio, images, text and PDF files\n- Built-in camera to take on-the-fly encrypted photos and videos\n- Ability to expose volumes to other applications\n- Unlocking volumes using fingerprint authentication\n- Volume auto-locking when the app goes in background\n\n<b>Permissions:</b>\n<b>Read & write access to shared storage:</b> required to access volumes located on shared storage.\n<b>Biometric/Fingerprint hardware:</b> needed to encrypt/decrypt password hashes using a fingerprint protected key.\n<b>Camera:</b> required to take encrypted photos or videos directly from the app.\n<b>Record audio:</b> required if you want sound on videos recorded with DroidFS.\n<b>Notifications:</b> used to report file operations progress and notify about volumes kept open\n\nAll of these permissions can be denied if you don't want to use the corresponding feature.\n\nDroidFS is free, open-source, and you can find the project's repository:\n- on GitHub: https://github.com/hardcore-sushi/DroidFS\n- on the Gitea instance of the Chapril project: https://forge.chapril.org/hardcoresushi/DroidFS\n\n<b>Warning !</b>\nSecurity is neither absolute nor definitive. DroidFS does not come with any warranty and should not be considered as an absolute safe way to store files.\n","repo":{"author":"Hardcore Sushi","repo":"https://forge.chapril.org/hardcoresushi/DroidFS"},"version":"d5f08dd612decfd0c99f2f33640cd029dd6cf892be065ff8950b91a339db7a59","site":null,"source":"https://forge.chapril.org/hardcoresushi/DroidFS","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,115,117,115,104,105,46,104,97,114,100,99,111,114,101,46,100,114,111,105,100,102,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,54,78,48,53,105,110,54,75,52,78,65,50,66,70,106,53,89,99,110,105,110,111,103,106,111,99,67,50,85,70,104,72,97,51,117,48,70,109,85,117,66,50,73,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
