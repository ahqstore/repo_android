An updated and improved derivative of PluckLock.\n\nThis polls the accelerometer in the background and will lock the phone if the\nsum of all non-gravitational forces ever exceeds the threshold.\n\n<i>PluckLockEx</i> loads immediately into its preferences page, where you can set\nthe only preference relevant to the app's operation: the threshold at which the\nphone will lock when it receives an acceleration jolt. The application will run\nin the background, constantly monitoring the accelerometer to determine if the\nphone has been taken from your hand. The app will start itself when you boot\nyour phone.","repo":{"author":"0xFireball","repo":"https://github.com/0xFireball/PluckLockEx"},"version":"9da74740527ccd4d471293929352da92c7ded7227c6b382d11b71595e023d6ae","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/0xFireball/PluckLockEx","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,120,121,122,46,105,114,105,100,105,117,109,105,111,110,46,112,108,117,99,107,108,111,99,107,101,120,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
