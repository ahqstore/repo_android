The app handles the mechanical propagation of these rules, letting you focus on the logical reasoning and strategy.\n\nThis is not a solver - you remain in full control and are responsible for your own logic.\n","repo":{"author":"theoden8","repo":"https://codeberg.org/theoden8/sudaku"},"usrVersion":"f239542e41bf502ef5a53d4e26c9fc6edc0c2c81a4405aeda972dc4a4dc4ac39","version":1771317815,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/theoden8/sudaku","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
