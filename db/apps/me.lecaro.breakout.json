Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.\nOh, and don't miss the ball, you don't have extra lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe app should work offline and perform well even on low-end devices.\nIt's very lean and does not take much storage space (Roughly 0.1MB).\nIf the app stutters, turn on \"fast mode\" in the settings.\nIf the game is too fast, enable \"kid mode\" in the settings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe in-game help will tell you more about how to play. Now go have some fun, and come share your best runs on our Discord.\n</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Renan LE CARO","repo":"https://gitlab.com/lecarore/breakout71"},"version":"65cf0e01df2f077ff735e64b48aec5a07f8ea3914b0a75f5f88bf823548d3ffe","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/lecarore/breakout71","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
