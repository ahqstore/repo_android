Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.\nOh, and don't miss the ball, you don't have extra lives.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe app should work offline and perform well even on low-end devices.\nIt's very lean and does not take much storage space (Roughly 0.1MB).\nIf the app stutters, turn on \"fast mode\" in the settings.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe in-game help will tell you more about how to play. Now go have some fun, and come share your best runs on our Discord.\n</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Renan LE CARO","repo":"https://gitlab.com/lecarore/breakout71"},"version":"7c0608c83384efd5794a4e7c5f1c79bdeb6157ebe7e08fdaf2e9c6e737019039","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/lecarore/breakout71","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
