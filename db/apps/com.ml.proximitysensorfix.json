If the application does not remain active in the background, disable battery optimizations on the app settings.\n\nNo ROOT required\n","repo":{"author":"Marco Lettieri","repo":"https://github.com/marcolettieri/proximitycallfix"},"version":"55e81b5da4a0d50040ca5e5922f151dde32ec7796e75b35097cd4b2fbea3426b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marcolettieri/proximitycallfix","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,109,108,46,112,114,111,120,105,109,105,116,121,115,101,110,115,111,114,102,105,120,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,103,67,56,52,68,86,65,111,116,110,103,112,107,78,74,110,103,102,120,48,116,69,56,77,81,69,70,69,77,95,77,112,49,68,84,65,120,55,84,71,52,74,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
