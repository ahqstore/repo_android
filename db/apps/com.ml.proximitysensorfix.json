If the application does not remain active in the background, disable battery optimizations on the app settings.\n\nNo ROOT required\n","repo":{"author":"Marco Lettieri","repo":"https://github.com/marcolettieri/proximitycallfix"},"usrVersion":"55e81b5da4a0d50040ca5e5922f151dde32ec7796e75b35097cd4b2fbea3426b","version":1760506862,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marcolettieri/proximitycallfix","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
