Next to this, separate Wi-Fi and mobile data tiles are also available if you just want to go back to the behaviour of Android 11 or lower.\n\nTapping the new unified internet tile will simply toggle between Wi-Fi and mobile data, which is exactly what I want it to do most of the time. This reduces the amount of taps needed from 3 (tap tile, disable wifi, enable data) to just 1 quick tap. In situations where you still want more control, long pressing the tile will redirect you to the relevant settings page.\n","repo":{"author":"Casper Verswijvelt","repo":"https://github.com/CasperVerswijvelt/Better-Internet-Tiles"},"version":"d76cc2346011194c09062df6a02d0dd2086a72f3c9c5af4e6cec209af17bde92","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/CasperVerswijvelt/Better-Internet-Tiles","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,98,101,46,99,97,115,112,101,114,118,101,114,115,119,105,106,118,101,108,116,46,117,110,105,102,105,101,100,105,110,116,101,114,110,101,116,113,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,105,115,99,55,81,118,87,117,109,65,102,101,106,95,104,48,120,52,95,67,122,101,79,116,70,45,99,121,54,54,108,101,95,53,83,54,103,53,112,71,71,114,103,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
