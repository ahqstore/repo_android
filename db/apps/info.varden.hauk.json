Meeting up with someone? Send them a Hauk link, and they can follow your location live on a map until you arrive to meet them.\n\nThis app requires that you have installed the Hauk backend on a server. Please see https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk for backend installation instructions.\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n* ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - for getting your location, so that it can be shared\n* FOREGROUND_SERVICE - for keeping the share running when the app is minimized\n* INTERNET - for communicating with your Hauk backend server\n\nHauk does not share your location data to anywhere except the Hauk backend server you specify within the app. A unique link will be generated for your location share when you start sharing; anyone with this link will be able to see your location in real-time for as long as you are sharing.\n","repo":{"author":"Marius Lindvall","repo":"https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk"},"version":"0965ffda20c419c69b081d4848abdd7502a1e3801a2e30124e0369dd2051478e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bilde2910/Hauk","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
