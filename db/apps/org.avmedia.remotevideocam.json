Zero configuration.\nRemote Video Cam transforms two Android devices into a secure, portable audio/video streaming system. It works completely offline, using your local LAN, Wi-Fi Aware, or Wi-Fi Direct to establish a robust link between devices.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n• Zero Configuration: Devices find each other automatically.\n• Privacy First: No internet required. No external servers. Your video stays on your devices.\n• Robust Connection: innovative connection logic that tries multiple methods (LAN, Wi-Fi Aware, Wi-Fi Direct) to ensure you stay connected.\n• Modern Material 3 Design: A beautiful, easy-to-use interface built with the latest Android technologies.\n• Two-Way Audio/Video: Use it as a baby monitor, home security cam, or walkie-talkie.\n\nMODES:\n• Camera Mode: Broadcasts video and audio.\n• Display Mode: views the remote stream.\n\nWARNING:\nThis app is for convenience only and is not a certified safety or medical monitoring device. Network connections can be unreliable. Please do not rely solely on this app for critical monitoring (like a baby monitor). We recommend placing a continuously moving object (like a clock) in the frame to verify the stream is active.\n","repo":{"author":"Ivo Zivkov","repo":"https://github.com/izivkov/RemoteVideoCam"},"usrVersion":"2d6276e827b9075623fd5dba114f9001f25bb359287e31f5dc5c64b42006e51e","version":1771100751,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/izivkov/RemoteVideoCam","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
