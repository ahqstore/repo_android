PurpleDock works in both Portrait and Landscape orientation. It works\nwhen connected to power and disconnected. GPS usage (used for speedometer) is\nthrottled when not connected to power in order to save battery life.\n\nPurpleDock allows customization of three of the launch buttons. The stickpin,\nheadphones, and microphone buttons are pre-assigned to Google Places, Google\nMusic, and Voice Search. To override these buttons, tap and hold for 1 second to\nbring up an editor. You will need to know the full name of the application and\nthe name of the Activity to launch, which can be got from\nhttps://f-droid.org/packages/com.ideasfrombrain.search_based_launcher_v2 or or the AndroidManifest.xml of\nthe source code of the app.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/ehcloninger/pf-public"},"version":"9124435a7c06fe3226be41391d797088e66588355f2375407c807f0f32d222cf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ehcloninger/pf-public","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
