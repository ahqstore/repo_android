It's a pretty niche UnifiedPush distributor mostly useful for development purposes and advanced users at this moment.\n\nTo work, it needs a static address even with the roaming. It is achievable with a custom network such as a VPN (eg. wireguard) or the yggdrasil network.\n\nFor more information about UnifiedPush, visit https://unifiedpush.org\n\n","repo":{"author":"NoProvider2Push","repo":"https://github.com/NoProvider2Push/android"},"version":"f44ed604e933a6acf308f659db16ed4e7af82f9adb46abc4f599948c481bd133","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/NoProvider2Push/android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
