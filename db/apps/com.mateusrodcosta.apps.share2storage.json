No problem! \nHave you ever ran into this scenario: you are using an app (such as a bank app) and you need to export a file urgently (for example, a bank statement in PDF). You want to download that file locally in your device, but the app doesn't offer any easy way to do so, the max it offers is the option to share the file, meaning you end up having to send it to yourself (or somebody else) via email or a instant messaging app, to only then having the option to save that file.\n\nThis happens because many apps choose to use the system's share functionality instead of doing the work to implement the required file saving logic. So, what can be done?\n\nIn those cases Save Locally might come in handy, you just choose it on the share sheet that comes up and it allows you to save the file anywhere locally in your device, it also shows the file details beforehand (though that can be skipped).\nAn option to intercept \"Open with\" intents is also available, allowing you to save files even if the source app were to try force viewing with a default viewer for that file type.\n\nSave Locally is FLOSS software (Free and Libre Open Source Software) developed with Jetpack Compose.
