It also removes exif data before sending the image. The modified image is saved in a separate folder in jpeg format. The original image remains unchanged.\n\nImagepipe will receive a send intent for images, modify the image and send the changed image onward. Therefore, it takes you only one touch to pipe the image before sending!\n\nThe image can also be edited with Imagepipe.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/Starfish/Imagepipe"},"version":"e6f270dd1c8367e3ccf18c2dde21419a3669cc41d85003ce141116e58ecda4f9","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/Starfish/Imagepipe","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,107,97,102,102,101,101,109,105,116,107,111,102,102,101,105,110,46,105,109,97,103,101,112,105,112,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,118,56,114,73,95,53,84,83,99,86,99,104,112,111,99,68,105,106,67,86,116,107,78,80,88,120,120,104,106,75,87,75,66,74,81,108,85,121,106,113,51,56,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
