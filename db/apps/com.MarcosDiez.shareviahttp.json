Just share the\nitem via the Share Menu and a mini web server will be started allowing others to\ndownload the file. If there are multiple files a zip archive will be created on\nthe fly. If https://f-droid.org/packages/com.google.zxing.client.android is installed a QR code can be\nproduced with the URL. It will only work if the recipient is on the same LAN if\nyou use WiFI but should work anywhere if you use GSM (2G/3G), though more\nslowly. The server can be stopped at any time from the screen that shows the URL\n(press the back button if you're on the barcode).","repo":{"author":"Marcos Diez","repo":"https://github.com/marcosdiez/shareviahttp"},"version":"4309ff8e85b9bdab0144fb6330fcb80f0e09f8b96926c7fb3bcc9aa2154d9d18","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marcosdiez/shareviahttp","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
