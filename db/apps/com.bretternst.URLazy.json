You can serve links from a GUI app on your workstation or from a\nRuby script on a local development server (source code in same repo).\n\nURLazy finds this list with no configuration required, provided you are\nconnected to your network via Wi-Fi. This makes it super easy to test your\nprojects on real devices without manually setting up bookmarks or entering URLs.\n\nThis is a better alternative to bookmarks or centralized index pages because new\ndevices require no set-up and you don't have to edit URLs every time your\nenvironment changes - or if you take your work home. URLazy uses multicast UDP\nto find collections of links. If your network administrator enables it, this can\neven work across a corporate WAN.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/bretternst/urlazy"},"version":"f419974bca790bbd269b4b5208bfaf27e15580df93659ccbf1a7dcc831dd54ce","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bretternst/urlazy","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,98,114,101,116,116,101,114,110,115,116,46,85,82,76,97,122,121,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
