In most cases this is either done by clicking a 'share' or 'navigate to' action. Such action triggers a so call 'Intent' and Android will promt the user to select an app to be used to handle that.\nUnfortunally the original BMW Connected-app does not show up here.\nHere is where 'send2car' comes into play - is an app capable or receiving intents for the geo-url-sheme and translating this event into a connected-drive message to be send to your car. As Geo-intends besides the coordinates do not contain much detail when receiving such geo-url-intent send2car will do some reverse-geocoding to retrieve additional data and offer to send the result to a bmw car via the services provides by the BMW Connected-drive portal. The message being send to the car is equivalent to message that is sent from the Map that you can find in Connected-drive app or portal. Actually send2car does use the very same web-services that the connected-drive-portal web-app uses.\nWhen opening the message in your cars head-unit you can choose to navigate to the precise location that is encoded within the message.\nTo use you need to configure your connected-drive accout in send2car and retrieve the associated VINs from connected-drive portal.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Norbert Truchsess","repo":"https://github.com/ntruchsess/send2car"},"version":"af8e56221d2476ecfa1c467086c82c22274d8eb0f7ea827476392dbf2bc8f346","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ntruchsess/send2car","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,116,114,117,99,104,115,101,115,115,46,115,101,110,100,50,99,97,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,50,82,75,88,89,99,77,81,111,72,121,106,57,83,78,120,70,90,105,116,97,114,80,49,103,71,87,109,66,75,77,100,87,115,101,98,118,78,49,89,49,49,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
