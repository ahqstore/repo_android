It will let you\nknow about new notifications by showing a minimal, beautiful screen, allowing\nyou to open them directly from the lock screen. And if you want to see what's\ngoing on, you can simply take your phone out of your pocket to view all the\nlatest notifications, in a similarly pleasing and minimalistic manner.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Great design and awesome performance.\n* Active mode (uses the device's sensors to wake your device up when you need it.)\n* Use AcDisplay as your lockscreen.\n* Translated to most popular languages.\n* Inactive hours (to save some battery.)\n* Enable only while charging.\n* Lots of other features such as: Blacklist, Dynamic background, Low-priority notifications and much more.\n\nThis app uses a precompiled library: XposedBridge.","repo":{"author":"Artem Chepurnoy (AChep)","repo":"https://github.com/AChep/AcDisplay"},"usrVersion":"3000c9fd85d8b4e9b3b4574045cdb5c6f20c769887dd1de36b4e2bbb3613b342","version":1761363283,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/AChep/AcDisplay","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
