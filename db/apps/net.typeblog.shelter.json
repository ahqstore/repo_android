A summary is provided below.\n\nThe main use-cases of Shelter include:\n\n- Installing apps inside a work profile for isolation\n- \"Freeze\" apps inside the work profile to prevent them from running or being woken up when you are not actively using them\n- Installing two copies of the same app on the same device\n\nNote that Shelter depends on the Work Profile feature of the Android system, so any bugs related to Work Profiles in the Android-derived system you are using will affect Shelter. In addition, Shelter can only be as secure as the Work Profile implementation.\n","repo":{"author":"PeterCxy","repo":"https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/Shelter"},"usrVersion":"d6d67b22f066d40f8771d8d7c0e0efe9315b37224d5b7e724f4c0e9b0eecca07","version":1760224583,"site":null,"source":"https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/Shelter","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
