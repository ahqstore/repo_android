Your phone, tablet, desktop, laptop, this program can be installed and run, not simply a website-in-a-box, but instead using native client side technologies to provide the best experience possible.\n\nOffline first\n\nI was frustrated with most of the story writing software I was finding as they were using web technologies (aka: Web Page in a box) which always seems to run into problems while being used offline for long periods of time. Hammer is designed from the ground up to be entirely local, no internet connection required, ever.\n\nTransparent Data\n\nYour data is yours. It's not stored in the cloud, or some opaque database. It is stored in simple, human readable files, just using files and folders to define the project structure. You can open your OSes file browser and take a look for your self. If this program went away today you would be able to easily interact with your data.\n\nIntelligent Syncing between devices\n\nYour data can be synchronized between devices allowing you to work on your story from anywhere, and have no fear of a change on one device, overwriting a change on another device.\n\nOptional and Self hosted Syncing\n\nSyncing is entirely optional, you can install the client and use it on one device, or you can install the server and sync your data between devices.","repo":{"author":"Adam Brown","repo":"https://github.com/Wavesonics/hammer-editor"},"version":"384d3534fe8161a63b61db0edd7d702874c1de09d881ef5c968cc3c0d3c9e530","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Wavesonics/hammer-editor","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,100,97,114,107,114,111,99,107,115,116,117,100,105,111,115,46,97,112,112,115,46,104,97,109,109,101,114,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,51,69,88,81,53,101,104,68,56,116,69,77,82,74,110,75,48,110,111,80,50,113,90,82,70,117,101,76,101,119,75,110,117,66,98,122,71,97,116,76,115,73,85,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
