A final number to be determined: Count the planks of the bridge ... Hey, where has the bridge gone?! It was replaced by a pipe beneath the ground. What now ...? Look up the logs for potential telephone jokers? No, then I'd rather draw a line in my map, where the final could be located given the formula and missing x ... But wait - Coordinate Joker will do it for you. Just enter the coordinate formulas and it will send the resulting waypoints to your preferred Geocaching app. With a bit of luck, one point will appear close to some path while the others may be far away. Then where would you look for the final? :)","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/siggel/coordinatejoker"},"version":"0e317443dfa38884a235b72991ae632645cc977ad4e00afc050ef9863d660c3c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/siggel/coordinatejoker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,115,105,103,103,101,108,46,99,111,111,114,100,105,110,97,116,101,106,111,107,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,53,53,71,115,82,48,54,71,104,76,56,55,70,77,53,115,84,83,107,113,122,103,65,98,111,120,85,78,74,80,101,68,110,79,97,86,119,120,83,120,65,104,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
