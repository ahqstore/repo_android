Android sometimes\nlaunches an app if it recognizes the URL, for example, a link to\nmaps.google.com will open in the Maps app. However, this does not work for\nshort URLs, they will open in a browser, and many browsers will then just\nopen the mobile web site corresponding to the link.\n\nThis app will take the short url, unshorten it, and give it back so that\nandroid can launch the correct application.\n\nOver 350 URL-shortening services are supported!","repo":{"author":"Nicolas Smith","repo":"https://github.com/nicolassmith/urlevaluator"},"version":"bfdf5522d659c053774365d114f752afad7062aab79045e27987e7301ec77f66","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/nicolassmith/urlevaluator","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,110,105,99,111,108,97,115,115,109,105,116,104,46,117,114,108,101,118,97,108,117,97,116,111,114,46,49,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
