Allows\nboth online and offline use. In addition to navigation, walkers may share\nand download footpath issues (blockages, directions etc) and walking\nroutes.\n\nAntifeatures:\n* NonFreeNet: The map data is OpenStreetMap-derived but it is downloaded\nfrom the Freemap server. OpenTrail does not currently send any personal\ninformation (such as your Google login) to the Freemap server. All data sent\nis completely anonymous. Location tracking (GPS) is used to find your\nlocation and to download nearby points of interest from the server. Server\nrequests (to find all points of interest close to a given GPS location) are\nlogged using standard server (Apache) logging; however they are not\nassociated with a username or name.","repo":{"author":"Nick Whitelegg","repo":"https://gitlab.com/nickw1/opentrail"},"version":"ccdc7a02e4e2cd1d59814ec7bda7111eb5a2713360f10fb39097d34203d40376","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/nickw1/opentrail","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,102,114,101,101,109,97,112,46,111,112,101,110,116,114,97,105,108,46,49,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
