This way, your cellphone can be used as a\nGPS in navigation or robotics applications running in a host computer.\n\nData is forwarded using UDP. First, make sure the computer's IP is reachable\nfrom your cellphone; this is the case in most default access points, so it\nshould work if both are connected to the same WiFi network.\n\nOn the host machine, execute `gpsd -N udp://:` (e.g. `gpsd -N udp://*:29998`). In\nthe app, enter your host's IP and port and hit Start. Your host is now\nreceiving GPS data forwarded from your phone. You can test it with gpsmon or\nother GPSd utilities.","repo":{"author":"Tiago Koji Castro Shibata","repo":"https://github.com/tiagoshibata/Android-GPSd-Client"},"version":"c9dc6b14d9f48ac4e8884f76da6e9e3c5db038d9992559039952dc49e3235aba","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tiagoshibata/Android-GPSd-Client","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,105,111,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,116,105,97,103,111,115,104,105,98,97,116,97,46,103,112,115,100,99,108,105,101,110,116,46,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
