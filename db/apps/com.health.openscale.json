Together with our users we constantly improve and extend the set of\nsupported scales and in many cases pick up where the original app falls short.\n\nFor scales without Bluetooth, or Bluetooth scales not (yet) supported by\nopenScale, measurements can be manually entered in a quick and easy way.\n\n<b>Privacy</b>\n\nThis app has no ads and requests no unnecessary permissions. The location\npermission is only needed to find a Bluetooth scale. Once found the permission\ncan be revoked (or never granted if Bluetooth isn't used).\n\n<b>Supported metrics</b>\n\nWeight, BMI (body mass index), body water, muscle, LBM (lean body mass), body\nfat, bone mass, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, hip circumference,\nwaist-hip ratio, visceral fat, chest circumference, thigh circumference, biceps\ncircumference, neck circumference, body fat caliper and BMR (basal metabolic\nrate). Each entry can also have an optional comment.\n\n<b>Note:</b> don't worry if you think the list is too long: metrics you don't use\ncan be disabled and hidden.\n\n<b>Other features</b>\n\n* Resizable widget to show the latest measurement on the home screen\n* Configure your weight unit: kg, lb or st\n* Set a goal to help keep your diet\n* Displays all your data on a chart and in a table to track your progress\n* Evaluates measurements and gives a quick visual feedback to show you if you're within or outside the recommended range given your age, sex, height etc.\n* Import or export your data from/into a CSV (comma separated value) file\n* Supports body fat, body water and lean body mass estimations based on scientific publications. Useful if your scale doesn't support those measurements.\n* Support for multiple users\n* Partially or fully translated into Catalan, Chinese (traditional), Czech, Dutch, English, French, Galician, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian Bokm√•l, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish\n* Optional dark theme\n\n<b>Supported Bluetooth scales</b>\n\n* Custom made Bluetooth scale\n* Beurer BF700, BF710 and BF800\n* Digoo DG-S038H\n* Excelvan CF369BLE\n* Exingtech Y1\n* Hesley (Yunchen)\n* MGB\n* Medisana BS444, BS440\n* Runtastic Libra\n* Sanitas SBF70\n* Silvercrest SBF75\n* Xiaomi Mi scale v1 and v2\n* Yunmai Mini and SE\n* iHealth HS3\n* Easy Home 64050\n* and many more\n\nPlease see\n<a href=\"https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale/wiki/Supported-scales-in-openScale\">Wikipage</a> for the full list and the level of support for each scale.\n\n<b>Support</b>\n\nIf you find a bug, have an idea on how to improve openScale or have a question,\nplease visit the openScale project page on\n<a href=\"https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale\">GitHub</a>","repo":{"author":"olie.xdev","repo":"https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale"},"version":"057defa9a0890680aef7577721a3ac28ee6c561dea6deb6e2f676c8669f3f55d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/oliexdev/openScale","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
