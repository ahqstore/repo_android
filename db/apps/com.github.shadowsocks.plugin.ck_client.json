This increases the collateral damage to censorship actions and therefore make it very difficult, if not impossible, for censors to selectively block censorship evasion tools and proxy servers without affecting services that the state may also heavily rely on.\n\nDetails on how Cloak works can be <a href='https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak'>found here</a>.\n\nShadowsocks-android is required, as well as a Cloak-compatible proxy server.\n","repo":{"author":"Andy Wang","repo":"https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak-android"},"usrVersion":"968c3c0b9d07795e22ac5dbc0b24da88dfdd1de0fc3fec643f30173098c1e696","version":1759814279,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
