This is a <i>very</i> impolite way of stopping apps. These might (and probably will) misbehave. You might also lose data because of this. <b>Beware!</b>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/drowser/tree/HEAD"},"version":"a695b428650c4ded57e2f89e851b29b03455c6da92951926b7f31327a79316b2","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/drowser/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
