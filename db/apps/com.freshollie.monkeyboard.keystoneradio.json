The Monkeyboard communicates\nvia USB serial, and so to use the board a USB Host cable is required to\nconnect the board to the Android device. The app is designed to act as if\nit is a normal music player as so will act accordingly. Audio focus will be\nfollowed, and a mediaplayer notification is provided.\n\nThe Monkeyboard does not transmit audio over the USB connection, it is only\noutputted directly from the board itsself. The user will need to mix this\naudio with the tablet audio externally (think of the Android device as\nbeing a screen for the Monkeyboard).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/freshollie/monkeyboard-radio-android"},"version":"cb894807a18c2b16ea2b7683ae9c69c3b7791b2260fba19a420346c1857bdadf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/freshollie/monkeyboard-radio-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,102,114,101,115,104,111,108,108,105,101,46,109,111,110,107,101,121,98,111,97,114,100,46,107,101,121,115,116,111,110,101,114,97,100,105,111,46,49,49,54,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
