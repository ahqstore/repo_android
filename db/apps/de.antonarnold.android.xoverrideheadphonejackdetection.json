To automatically select between these, a mechanical switch is added to detect a plugged in cable. If this switch breaks and replacing it is not realistic, your phone may become more or less unusable. With this module you are able to manually control the headphone detection state and continue using your phone.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/anton-arnold/xoverrideheadphonejackdetection"},"version":"6025af5ee85dd636fbfc203e79c75c9686f9270169276c1597dcee8792e7fdb7","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/anton-arnold/xoverrideheadphonejackdetection","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,97,110,116,111,110,97,114,110,111,108,100,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,120,111,118,101,114,114,105,100,101,104,101,97,100,112,104,111,110,101,106,97,99,107,100,101,116,101,99,116,105,111,110,46,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
