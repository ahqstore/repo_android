It acts as a simple Tor \"provider\" for apps to hide their Internet traffic by encrypting it, then bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. \n\nThis app is a complement to Orbot, which provides the full, \"batteries included\" Tor utility.\n","repo":{"author":"Guardian Project","repo":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices"},"usrVersion":"64067cdf817e3bd66aa8986898b1748a59f22b5cd95d267020523a32abeb1d37","version":1760642163,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
