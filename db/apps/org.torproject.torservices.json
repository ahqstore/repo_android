It acts as a simple Tor \"provider\" for apps to hide their Internet traffic by encrypting it, then bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. \n\nThis app is a complement to Orbot, which provides the full, \"batteries included\" Tor utility.\n","repo":{"author":"Guardian Project","repo":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices"},"version":"64067cdf817e3bd66aa8986898b1748a59f22b5cd95d267020523a32abeb1d37","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/guardianproject/torservices","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,116,111,114,112,114,111,106,101,99,116,46,116,111,114,115,101,114,118,105,99,101,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,78,84,113,68,107,85,83,82,115,80,90,102,50,52,102,88,95,101,69,109,76,119,74,55,57,74,84,97,79,85,70,54,122,103,50,52,119,112,67,103,108,106,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
