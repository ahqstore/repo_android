The supplied data for hills of the UK and Ireland is better than\nthat for the rest of the world.\n\n<b>N.B</b> Although it is not necessary (since v0.30) to have Google Maps\ninstalled to install the app, attempting to view the map overlay mode if you\ndon't have Google maps installed, will crash the app. Even if you have that\ninstalled the \"birds eye\", map overlay mode won't work because the only map\nsource is Google Maps and there isn't an API key in the source code.\n\nAnti-feature: Tracking. Crash reports are sent without interaction, but that can\nbe disabled in the settings. Google Analytics was removed before building.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills"},"version":"eee33337d1761c43455ae35bbe0082110c624334f686742f9298b25906c8e4e3","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ShowMeHills/ShowMeHills","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,115,104,111,119,109,101,104,105,108,108,115,46,51,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
