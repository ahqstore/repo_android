The size of the file and the last date modified are also displayed.\nThe last feature helps you to compare the calculated hash with another given hash but more generally, you can compare any hashes by just pasting them.\n\nA hash (also called checksum or digest) is a digital fingerprint, uniquely identifying a string or a file.\nHash functions are often used in cryptography to generate strong passwords. They are also employed to check the integrity of files.\nHash Droid is often used to check an Android ROM before flashing it.","repo":{"author":"Hobby One","repo":"https://github.com/HobbyOneDroid/HashDroid"},"version":"2d51dfe601ba5de66d841f377ac1b3833128ef1f4ee86539070cb5b6fa53d589","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/HobbyOneDroid/HashDroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,104,111,98,98,121,111,110,101,46,72,97,115,104,68,114,111,105,100,46,50,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
