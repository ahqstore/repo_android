This includes the 'DCIM' camera image folder as well as 'Downloads'.\n\nWhen the \"start\" button is pressed and the device has Wifi connectivity, the app will\nopen a rsync server on a random port with a random tag (\"module\" in rsync parlance).\nIt will display all necessary details on how to connect to that server while it is\nrunning, e.g.\n\nrsync://192.168.123.123:66671/abcdef/\n\nUsing a standard rsync client the server can then be interrogated and files moved back and\nforth, i.e. to and from the phone. The benefit is that the transfers can be driven from\nthe client desktop, the keyboard and mouse interface of which making the process much\nmore convenient.\n\nNote: This app has not been widely tested and should therefore be considered alpha quality.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/ktsr42/RsyncServerApp"},"usrVersion":"bafb0453bb612e3e9843c695a40153fcfb82261ab263526fbd173508ace438ea","version":1768056185,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ktsr42/RsyncServerApp","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
