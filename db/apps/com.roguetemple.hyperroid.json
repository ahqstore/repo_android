As a Rogue, your goal\nis to collect as many treasures as possible. However, collecting treasures\nattracts dangerous monsters (on the other hand, killing the monsters allows more\ntreasures to be generated).\n\nYou can kill most monsters by moving into them. Similarly, if the monster was\nnext to you at the end of your turn, it would kill you. The game protects you\nfrom getting yourself killed accidentally by ignoring moves which lead to\ninstant death (similar to the check rule from Chess).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue"},"usrVersion":"496cc9c0a2366aa8a2c30ae1f4dc9f7b75c2e493b24a3520d50f082308bebed0","version":1760901238,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
