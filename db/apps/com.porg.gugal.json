Developers are free to add more search engines.\n\nTo use Gugal with Google Search you need a CSE ID and API key. Instructions for obtaining both can be found in the app. <b>To get these you have to have a Google account, therefore Google might still link searches to your account. If you want to use a search engine that respects your privacy more, use Gugal with a searx/SearXNG instance.</b>\n\n<i>Google and Google Search are trademarks of Google LLC.</i>\n","repo":{"author":"Narek","repo":"https://gitlab.com/narektor/gugal"},"version":"3d3cbdd5236d1909fde91996ff89052f3c9f37a1762e44525956ad34f9e381c9","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/narektor/gugal","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,112,111,114,103,46,103,117,103,97,108,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,77,52,74,66,75,50,106,52,70,107,116,78,119,99,107,54,81,69,106,87,97,74,89,81,75,53,75,75,84,70,109,66,90,90,95,50,68,98,50,106,113,117,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
