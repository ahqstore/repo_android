It can be used for monitoring or measuring environmental sound or noise; help tuning instruments; timing short sound events; and educational purpose.\n\n<br><b>Features:</b>\n\n* No Ads.\n* With log or linear frequency axis.\n* Can label frequency axis using music pitch note.\n* Support all possible sampling rates and almost all recorder sources of your device.\n* Graph with nice grid lines and labels, easy to operate.\n* FFT sample size range from 64 to 32768. Using half-overlapped (adjustable) time window to increase time resolution.\n* Various window functions provided, for different frequency resolution and dynamical range.\n* Peak frequency detection (in unit of Hz and note+cent), with a moderate accuracy (FFT + interpolation).\n* With dB or A-weighting dB (dBA).\n* Can record the audio in wav (PCM) format.\n* Pinch to zoom, drag or swipe to move, long-press to place cursor, double touch to reset zoom.\n\n<b>Notes: May need some knowledge of discrete Fourier transform and spectrum analysis to use it well. The actual accuracy mainly depends on your device. No calibration interface provided.\n","repo":{"author":"woheller69","repo":"https://github.com/woheller69/audio-analyzer-for-android"},"version":"e1680e38a803fbfc1958793ef143d1b286fb3de3da89fa7188e48c442314b07f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/woheller69/audio-analyzer-for-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,119,111,104,101,108,108,101,114,54,57,46,97,117,100,105,111,95,97,110,97,108,121,122,101,114,95,102,111,114,95,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,54,57,104,48,104,104,57,45,82,83,114,66,107,79,75,49,72,57,97,118,99,114,67,108,71,89,120,83,45,106,88,119,119,69,89,88,95,117,109,97,65,115,103,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
