It can be used for monitoring or measuring environmental sound or noise; help tuning instruments; timing short sound events; and educational purpose.\n\n<br><b>Features:</b>\n\n* No Ads.\n* With log or linear frequency axis.\n* Can label frequency axis using music pitch note.\n* Support all possible sampling rates and almost all recorder sources of your device.\n* Graph with nice grid lines and labels, easy to operate.\n* FFT sample size range from 64 to 32768. Using half-overlapped (adjustable) time window to increase time resolution.\n* Various window functions provided, for different frequency resolution and dynamical range.\n* Peak frequency detection (in unit of Hz and note+cent), with a moderate accuracy (FFT + interpolation).\n* With dB or A-weighting dB (dBA).\n* Can record the audio in wav (PCM) format.\n* Pinch to zoom, drag or swipe to move, long-press to place cursor, double touch to reset zoom.\n\n<b>Notes: May need some knowledge of discrete Fourier transform and spectrum analysis to use it well. The actual accuracy mainly depends on your device. No calibration interface provided.\n","repo":{"author":"woheller69","repo":"https://github.com/woheller69/audio-analyzer-for-android"},"usrVersion":"4c8bbc9b5d0f5bf8c0644641c1404bcf57bef0826394e5d482ae09a3c07f819c","version":1760654339,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/woheller69/audio-analyzer-for-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
