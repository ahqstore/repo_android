Galnet is part of the Multilingual Central Repository (http://adimen.si.ehu.es/web/MCR) and the Open Multilingual Wordnet (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/iliomw/omw). Galnet contents can be searched with several web applications and can also be downloaded in RDF and LMF formats with a free license (http://sli.uvigo.gal/download/SLI_Galnet/).\n\nInformation and contact: Xavier Gómez Guinovart (xgg2021@gmail.com)\n","repo":{"author":"Xavier Gómez Guinovart","repo":"https://github.com/xavier-gz/digalnet"},"version":"3fcbf631157307b006e19cff846ba638a8047555d1ae4a597c146d070336a55d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/xavier-gz/digalnet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,103,97,108,46,115,108,105,46,100,105,103,97,108,110,101,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,103,50,88,98,108,101,50,67,75,75,115,122,74,81,66,105,99,104,50,119,78,51,106,97,99,67,53,53,72,87,67,50,111,53,90,67,85,78,67,75,103,75,119,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
