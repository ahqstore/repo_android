It provides a modern aviation glass cockpit attitude and flight instrument display.\n\n<b>Digital Moving Map</b>\n\nThe built in map module provides  situational awareness and and navigation functionality. EFIS can optionally integrate with the Stratux ADS-B/AHRS to provide real-time traffic overlay.\n\n<b>Synthetic Vision</b>\n\nSynthetic vision is built from the USGS 3 arc second Digital Elevation Model data. If enabled, it also allows for some terrain collision detection. The required terrain data packages are available via F-Droid, see:\n\nhttps://f-droid.org/en/packages/player.efis.data.usa.can - North America, Canada\nhttps://f-droid.org/en/packages/player.efis.data.eur.rus - Europe, Russia\nhttps://f-droid.org/en/packages/player.efis.data.sah.jap - Sahara / North Africa, India / Indonesia, Japan\nhttps://f-droid.org/en/packages/player.efis.data.eur.rus - Southern Africa, Australia / New Zealand\nhttps://f-droid.org/en/packages/player.efis.data.pan.arg - South America\n\n<b>Flight Director</b>\n\nKwik EFIS has a fully functional flight director built in. It uses the standard V-Bar symbology common to modern flight directors. The target waypoint and altitude is set on-screen by means of the spinner controls on the right top and bottom of the screen.\n\n<b>Airspace</b>\n\nAirspace data is provided from Worldwide Soaring Services Turnpoint Exchange Airspace (http://soaringweb.org/Airspace/)\n\n<b>ADS-B/AHRS</b>\n\nIn addition to the internal sensors, a low cost Stratux ADS-B/AHRS can be selected as the input source. See http://www.stratux.me/ for more information.\n\n<b>Simulator</b>\n\nThere is a simulation mode available in the application. The Flight director is used to select a waypoint and altitude and the simulator will generate the GPS movements to navigate to the selected waypoint. The speed is set at the typical cruise for the currently selected aircraft.\n\n<b>Installation</b>\n\nFor application and installation help, see: https://ninelima.org/efis/instructions.html\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/ninelima/kwikEFIS"},"version":"f97bbe10829df70ecbe86049681de4697b0a1ab0d2b21215ae8fcb38034e79ef","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/ninelima/kwikEFIS","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,112,108,97,121,101,114,46,101,102,105,115,46,112,102,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,101,48,70,48,112,53,101,104,104,111,89,97,109,79,56,68,66,111,95,89,103,70,98,121,45,67,97,80,118,50,122,51,112,118,106,98,86,97,88,74,57,50,119,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
