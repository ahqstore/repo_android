These generate Tasks, set limits to how many characters may be\nused, and which solutions are successful an which are not.\n\nAll game modes are based on the same concept: the Task to solve will be\ndisplayed on the screen as soon as possible (near immediately for Random game,\nlonger for REDB game), and then the user has to enter a regular expression to\nsolve the task. As soon as it fits to conditions, it will be automatically\nsubmitted, and the next task will generate - no questions asked. The user will\nbe notified in case s?he rises up a level.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/phikal/ReGeX"},"version":"36a6bde6bc0704f21dd57a8737a9054801e8b8cf74668be35003ce7aa7b989c8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/phikal/ReGeX","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,112,104,105,107,97,108,46,114,101,103,101,120,46,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
