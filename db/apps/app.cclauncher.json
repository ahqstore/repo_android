Rewrite of C\nCCLauncher is a minimalist Android launcher designed to help reduce screen time and distractions due to all the apps present (like social media apps for example). Unlike traditional launchers, apps are hidden by default.\n\nKey Features:\n- Apps invisible by default (type to search)\n- Digital wellbeing tools (screen time tracking)\n- Double-tap to lock screen\n- Customizable gestures (swipe left/right/up/down shortcuts)\n- App renaming/hiding capabilities\n- Plain black/white wallpapers for focus\n- No ads, no tracking, no internet permission - 100% private\n\nUsage Tips:\n1. Swipe up to search apps\n2. Long press empty space for settings\n3. Enable double-tap lock in Accessibility settings\n4. Rename duplicate-named apps for easier launching\n\nThis is a modern rewrite of Clauncher using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, maintaining most of the minimalism while improving functionality (and maybe performance...)\n","repo":{"author":"MLM Games","repo":"https://github.com/mlm-games/cclauncher"},"usrVersion":"703514e317128d19390798b92f819ba0cf93f8bdd739b4e65e6b329d4be16c3b","version":1760621436,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mlm-games/cclauncher","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
