E.g. a group of cells labeled with '5+' must be filled such that the sum of all digits is 5.\n\nVia game options, you may alter the game to solve other digits, smaller or greater grids, hiding the operators.\n\n\n<b>Slick and modern UI</b>\n\n- No switching of 'pencil mode' or such thing is  needed: To set a value of a cell, just use short-tap to alter a possible value and long-tap for a known value.\n- 'Fast Finishing Mode' enables to fill cell with exactly one pencil mark rapidly. To be activated in the preferences.\n- Uses colors from the painting 'The Siesta' from Paul Gauguin (guess where the app's name comes fromâ€¦)\n\n\n<b>Game options</b>\n\n- grid sizes: 3x3 to 11x11 with classic 9x9\n- includes rectangular grids, e.g. 7x9\n- operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)\n- digits (1 to n, prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence etc.)\n- difficulty (covering a increasing number of game variants)\n- usage of single cells\n- show or hide operators\n\n\n<b>Things still to be done</b>\n\n- not all grid variants get calculated in a reasonable time\n- on-boarding is missing a tutorial\n- not all game variants have been supplied with difficulty ratings yet\n- calculation of next grid is not bullet proof in some rare circumstances\n","repo":{"author":"Meik Piepmeyer","repo":"https://github.com/meikpiep/gauguin"},"usrVersion":"ba29c7c661a204b98fed736224cd01398c6ac188914e1d5e824e0b81b91f30d9","version":1759994301,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/meikpiep/gauguin","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
