E.g. a group of cells labeled with '5+' must be filled such that the sum of all digits is 5.\n\nVia game options, you may alter the game to solve other digits, smaller or greater grids, hiding the operators.\n\n\n<b>Slick and modern UI</b>\n\n- No switching of 'pencil mode' or such thing is  needed: To set a value of a cell, just use short-tap to alter a possible value and long-tap for a known value.\n- Beta feature: 'Fast Finishing Mode' enables to fill cell with exactly one pencil mark rapidly. To be activated in the preferences. Feedback welcome, use the menu item 'Bugs and Features'.\n- Uses colors from the painting 'The Siesta' from Paul Gauguin (guess where the app's name comes from...)\n\n\n<b>Game options</b>\n\n- grid sizes: 3x3 to 11x11 with classic 9x9\n- includes rectangular grids, e.g. 7x9\n- operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)\n- digits (1 to n, prime numbers, fibonacci sequence etc.)\n- difficulty (covering a incresing number of game variants)\n- usage of single cells\n- show or hide operators\n\n\n<b>Things still to be done</b>\n\n- small grids do not adjust to screen sizes properly, being shown way too huge\n- not all grid variants get calculated in a reasonable time (e.g. a 4x8 grid will likely need more time than your battery wants to give)\n- onboarding is missing a tutorial\n- various UI related optimization work\n- not all game variants have been supplied with difficulty ratings yet\n- calculation of next grid is not bullet proof in some rare circumstances","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/meikpiep/gauguin"},"version":"98c23a41f770af88e4f31cb91051e2df8c69cac0bbbc64f2f5ee4bc64517de48","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/meikpiep/gauguin","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,112,105,101,112,109,101,121,101,114,46,103,97,117,103,117,105,110,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,80,112,48,73,116,104,89,106,52,82,69,54,79,95,51,66,81,99,100,95,65,112,90,87,86,56,105,78,101,105,57,108,95,76,115,112,73,75,74,73,111,97,107,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
