The icons avoid overly saturated or dark colors, and softly bulge out the \"straight\" lines away from the center for a plushie-like look.\n\nDollphone Icon Pack is a crystallization of years of passion for the “yurukawa” aesthetic.\n\nThere are also original smartphone wallpapers that harmonize with the icons! You can also view and download them [on the website](https://haleyhalcyon.gitlab.io/dollphone/wallpaper.html).","repo":{"author":"HaleyW","repo":"https://gitlab.com/haleyhalcyon/dollphone"},"usrVersion":"cb0ff434bd9bd378102fd5b6e5fe7625af85def23c44974edf02b95877a98136","version":1760913573,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/haleyhalcyon/dollphone","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
