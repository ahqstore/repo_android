The icons avoid overly saturated or dark colors, and softly bulge out the \"straight\" lines away from the center for a plushie-like look.\n\nDollphone Icon Pack is a crystallization of years of passion for the “yurukawa” aesthetic.\n\nThere are also original smartphone wallpapers that harmonize with the icons! You can also view and download them [on the website](https://haleyhalcyon.gitlab.io/dollphone/wallpaper.html).","repo":{"author":"HaleyW","repo":"https://gitlab.com/haleyhalcyon/dollphone"},"version":"cb0ff434bd9bd378102fd5b6e5fe7625af85def23c44974edf02b95877a98136","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/haleyhalcyon/dollphone","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,109,101,46,120,50,103,100,52,46,100,111,108,108,112,104,111,110,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,81,86,73,85,90,116,65,102,122,77,76,113,87,82,68,73,56,122,121,55,73,56,70,74,84,81,66,115,112,45,107,48,115,45,79,66,72,110,107,73,98,95,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
