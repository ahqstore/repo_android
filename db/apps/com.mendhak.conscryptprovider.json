I'm putting it on F-Droid in case it benefits others too.","repo":{"author":"Mendhak","repo":"https://github.com/mendhak/Conscrypt-Provider"},"version":"08ef2e7d0bdfe4aa9c6399ada96b694ace3aa32d6cf8c90fe80320b534ec5126","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mendhak/Conscrypt-Provider","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,109,101,110,100,104,97,107,46,99,111,110,115,99,114,121,112,116,112,114,111,118,105,100,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,50,77,81,76,56,110,79,95,107,79,75,109,119,102,88,45,69,50,82,114,80,88,97,78,70,103,99,89,82,48,88,95,122,65,73,89,67,95,107,57,81,106,81,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
