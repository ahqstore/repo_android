It is able to do the following calculations:\n\nPolar calculations:\n\n* station orientation\n* free station\n* polar survey\n* polar implantation\n* axis implantation\n\nOrthogonal calculations:\n\n* orthogonal survey\n* orthogonal tracking\n* orthogonal implantation\n\nIntersections calculations:\n\n* lines intersections\n* circles intersections\n* line / circle intersections\n\nSurface calculations:\n\n* surface included with arc of a circle\n* parallel limit displacement regarding compulsory surface\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n* field / distance\n* point projection on a line\n* circle computation using three points\n* arc of a circle segmentation\n\nMathematics:\n\n* triangle solver\n* circular elements resolution\n\nData, such as points, can be imported into the application from CSV, LTOP or PTP\nfile formats and exported to CSV. The history of all the calculations, the\npoints and application settings can be exported to file (*.tpst) which can be\nimported into other instances of the application or simply later on.","repo":{"author":"HGdev","repo":"https://github.com/hgdev-ch/toposuite-android"},"version":"05e3f19e2717b1a9fd0cbaf66f8409559536244fbd2f23c104ec37c8eff72c56","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/hgdev-ch/toposuite-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
