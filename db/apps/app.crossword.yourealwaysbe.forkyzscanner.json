The scan results can be edited to make corrections. The puzzle can then be shared with other apps (e.g. Forkyz) for playing.\n\nThe app is somewhat heavyweight: it includes OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for text recognition. Language packs for text recognition must be downloaded from settings before this feature can be used.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/Hague/forkyzscanner"},"version":"c189f37be18dca21a4dbac8433bb8b82fd688de64a45dc6b0b91a17dc189cf05","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/Hague/forkyzscanner","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,97,112,112,46,99,114,111,115,115,119,111,114,100,46,121,111,117,114,101,97,108,119,97,121,115,98,101,46,102,111,114,107,121,122,115,99,97,110,110,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,111,112,112,104,48,114,50,89,95,89,117,77,71,54,98,106,105,98,108,73,95,67,114,122,103,97,119,76,85,122,67,108,45,87,95,105,83,101,98,118,78,80,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
