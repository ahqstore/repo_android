The scan results can be edited to make corrections. The puzzle can then be shared with other apps (e.g. Forkyz) for playing.\n\nThe app is somewhat heavyweight: it includes OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for text recognition. Language packs for text recognition must be downloaded from settings before this feature can be used.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/Hague/forkyzscanner"},"version":"c189f37be18dca21a4dbac8433bb8b82fd688de64a45dc6b0b91a17dc189cf05","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/Hague/forkyzscanner","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
