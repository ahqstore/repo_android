An English wordlist is included but there is a\nlink to the website to download wordlists to play in other languages.\n\nThe source code supports push messaging via Google Play, but that won't function\nin this build even if Google Play is installed. It just means that moves won't\nbe transmitted quite as quickly as if it were supported. Play via SMS or\nBluetooth is unaffected by this.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"http://xwords.sourceforge.net/source.php"},"usrVersion":"843440b8dfc9cd310780af91896a66f3ba3b3f45c41517d0c9af669152714d5a","version":1760246198,"site":null,"source":"http://xwords.sourceforge.net/source.php","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
