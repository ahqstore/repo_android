Keep a private directory of the aircraft that belong to your club or friends and see how far they are. For free and without advertisements.\n\nPrivacy note: the application needs to send your location to the OGN in order to listen for aircraft beacons around you and because the OGN doesnâ€™t support encryption, this happens in clear text. The good news is that OGN AR Viewer reduces the location accuracy to about 5 km before transmitting it and then restores it back on recipient, so the fine location never leaves your device. It further anonymizes you by connecting to the OGN without identification (other clients based on the official library generate an identifier based on your hostname). Check out the privacy policy to learn more (it is written in simple language and has illustrations).","repo":{"author":"Ivan Akulinchev","repo":"https://github.com/akulinchev/ognarviewer"},"version":"64774be66ae33b676f9d494f05bc37c2c2214263be17d12a8c172f54f3bee2aa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/akulinchev/ognarviewer","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,109,101,46,116,101,115,116,99,97,115,101,46,111,103,110,97,114,118,105,101,119,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,49,51,122,107,106,122,120,102,79,106,56,118,84,77,119,107,121,122,83,116,106,83,98,101,68,114,81,97,70,68,85,83,115,75,112,55,65,55,98,112,101,81,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
