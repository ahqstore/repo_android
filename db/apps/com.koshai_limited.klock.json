It is built to keep the minimal requirement for a clock application. We play chess locally anywhere. Sometimes we are badly in need of a clock. May be we don't need the complicated rules and play very easily. There Klock may come in handy.\n\nIt is a simple application. You don't need to be online for the app being functional. Just open the app, give your time configuration and that's it!","repo":{"author":"M.H.
