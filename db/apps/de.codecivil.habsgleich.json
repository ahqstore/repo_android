The choice and language of the adventures should be consistent over time and the time between noting two subsequent adventures should not vary too much from one day.\n\nAfter some time the app begins to choose adventures from the diary for mind testing. This choice is adaptive to your mind performance in such a way that you always can expect to have more positive than negative results.\n\nThe test results are amalgated into a single number, the \"mind index\". Its value is roughly the number of days you still remember your adventures rather well after.\n\nThe temporal graph of this mind index is displayed on the statistics page of the app.\n\nThe diary can be used to search, edit and remove adventures.\n\nSome screenshots display quotes by Henry David Thoreau.\n","repo":{"author":"codecivil.de","repo":"https://gitlab.com/codecivil/habsgleich/"},"version":"ef927741132cf9a77bfc022c0e1f340c08db004e98030c0a1db0ca1072a5d7b7","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/codecivil/habsgleich/","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,99,111,100,101,99,105,118,105,108,46,104,97,98,115,103,108,101,105,99,104,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,116,80,67,114,67,120,104,88,50,76,114,77,72,87,120,100,74,115,48,73,65,85,45,73,100,69,52,69,73,78,72,71,55,87,74,114,95,117,48,107,97,50,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
