Find two marbles and an empty location lying together along a line -- that is\n\"marble-marble-empty\" or \"empty -marble-marble\". This pattern can be in\nhorizontal or vertical direction.\n\n2. Select the marble away from the empty location. Then select the empty\nlocation. The selected marble will jump over the adjacent one to the empty\nlocation: now the pattern will be \"empty-empty-marble\" or \"marble-empty-empty\".\nThe middle marble gets removed by this. Similarly, go on removing the marbles\none by one till you reach a state when there are no two marbles together with an\nadjacent vacant position.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/easwareapps/marbleone"},"usrVersion":"26b41b3987af5ae29ca656e1ca015c6b65804d8e01939ca985fe02646f6d381f","version":1761061305,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/easwareapps/marbleone","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
