It also provides a monthly\noverview of your progress.\n\nA major feature in this application is the ability to share your sessions\nonline. Though entirely optional, sharing your progress online adds another\ndimension to your accountability. Now that you've gone public, as your\nmeditation streak increases more users will see it as a goal of their own. One\nuser has posted over 500 days of consecutive days of meditation.\n\nYour meditation streak is the number of consecutive days you have recorded at\nleast one session. As your streak grows, \"not breaking the chain\" becomes quite\nimportant. Soon you will be meditating once a day, even if it's five or ten\nminutes out of your schedule.","repo":{"author":"Trevor Slocum","repo":"https://codeberg.org/tslocum/meditationassistant.git"},"usrVersion":"d06b3b425c6f449f41f4ffb32c04fcc00fe9b3cad36b113e8bd764f036631624","version":1760334128,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/tslocum/meditationassistant.git","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
