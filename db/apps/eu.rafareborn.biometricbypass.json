It applies the bypass system-wide — so it works across <strong>all apps</strong>, including banking or security-sensitive ones.</p><p>Android introduced the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/biometric-auth#no-explicit-user-action\"><code>setConfirmationRequired(false)</code></a> flag in Android 10 to support passive authentication flows (e.g., face unlock without requiring a tap). Since most apps don’t disable confirmation explicitly, Android defaults to requiring a manual tap, turning face unlock into a two-step chore.</p><p>This module ensures the confirmation step is skipped across all biometric flows, regardless of app implementation.</p>","repo":{"author":"hxreborn","repo":"https://github.com/hxreborn/biometric-bypass"},"usrVersion":"81e3350bdaed6b9d9454f0e82eff2b97b6a7297d70be270878d90975e66e5c76","version":1768368254,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/hxreborn/biometric-bypass","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
