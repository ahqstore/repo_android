If in your country a warn-app is in place that makes use of the Framework you can see how many devices around you have the potential to exchange randomised & anonymous contact tracing information that can help to follow possible infection chains.\n\nPlease note that this app does not make use of the ExposureNotification Framework itself - nor it creates any BluetoothLE Beacon - the app also does not store any information about you or other devices that will be detected.\n","repo":{"author":"marq24","repo":"https://github.com/marq24/UUID0xFD6FTracer"},"version":"1319afd0c97d5da0c4542a840fc924aa61537d0b5de2f3a5b2fe6ae6c00aab53","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/marq24/UUID0xFD6FTracer","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,101,109,97,99,98,101,114,114,121,46,117,117,105,100,48,120,102,100,54,102,115,99,97,110,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,113,101,114,107,80,88,74,119,55,84,51,84,105,80,98,101,82,79,74,119,116,45,116,120,102,57,76,53,106,70,119,84,86,69,70,82,101,116,117,74,67,105,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
