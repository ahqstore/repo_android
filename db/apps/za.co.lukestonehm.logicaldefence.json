Never accept a logical fallacy, attack the attacker, and spread logic and reason to those you love.\n\nOk, enough rambling. This is an app that displays a list of the logical fallacies that haunt every rationalists' mind.\n\nSome features:\n\n- Left drawer that houses categories.\n- Share function -> Long press a fallacy to share it.\n- Nice about screen.\n- Language selection function.\n\nThis is a fully open-source project (GNU v2), and the source is hosted on GitHub so feel free to fork me :)\n\nFeel free to leave your comments/suggestions. Thank you for downloading!\n","repo":{"author":"LukeStoneHm","repo":"https://github.com/LukeStonehm/LogicalDefence"},"version":"6f7a6af0fe4a333acdcf0271e46bb739276b3b9fc677df50e05f0a2175b81a48","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/LukeStonehm/LogicalDefence","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
