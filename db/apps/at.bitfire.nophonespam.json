Get rid of phone spam and people you\ndon't want to talk with. Just block them. You can determine if you want to see\nthat someone called or even block any notification. NoPhoneSpam is focused on\nsimplicity! It's not cluttered with hundreds of unused features and we don't use\nany ads.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n\n* Block incoming calls\n* Use special syntax to block countries or providers or parts of numbers\n* Add, update and delete numbers\n* Manage notifications\n* Simple logging of numbers\n* Block calls with suppressed numbers\n\nNoPhoneSpam is NOT intended as a feature-rich call-spam fighting app, but as a\nreplacement for Android's missing call blocking feature. If you have Android 6+,\nyou don't need this app, because call blocking should be supported natively!","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/NoPhoneSpam"},"version":"5b88249519be848d64f4c040c355e271c51e545c82fcfaf9240f73dfa3cd3aaf","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/bitfireAT/NoPhoneSpam","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,97,116,46,98,105,116,102,105,114,101,46,110,111,112,104,111,110,101,115,112,97,109,46,49,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
