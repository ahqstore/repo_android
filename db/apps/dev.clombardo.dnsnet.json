You can download host files to block a set of known advertising or malicious host names and then create exemptions where you see fit.\n\nIt works by creating a lightweight VPN service that filters your internet traffic as you use your device. If you ever have trouble with connecting to a site or using an app, you can always exempt an app from filtering or create an exception for a specific host name.\n","repo":{"author":"Charles Lombardo","repo":"https://github.com/t895/DNSNet"},"version":"d3013d725472652f9ecc5e1a5c3a6482d07332525bf948e856ba766106dc553c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/t895/DNSNet","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,118,46,99,108,111,109,98,97,114,100,111,46,100,110,115,110,101,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,102,104,67,86,75,111,87,85,55,80,116,55,76,82,87,76,89,49,65,110,104,66,48,78,66,82,48,88,117,45,114,72,108,113,120,114,117,88,73,74,57,85,115,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
