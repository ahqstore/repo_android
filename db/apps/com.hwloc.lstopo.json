It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs.\n\nhwloc primarily aims at helping applications with <b>gathering information about increasingly complex parallel computing platforms so as to exploit them accordingly and efficiently.</b> For instance, two tasks that tightly cooperate should probably be placed onto cores sharing a cache. However, two independent memory-intensive tasks should better be spread out onto different sockets so as to maximize their memory throughput.\n","repo":{"author":"Inria","repo":"https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc"},"version":"8f03fd4e6a686fcd75e6a945e315ce6f3a0cb981d7596c90decb8efd9b1ed0e0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,104,119,108,111,99,46,108,115,116,111,112,111,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,107,89,104,116,105,85,99,55,101,103,102,104,112,71,72,84,113,102,112,113,56,114,104,55,118,119,75,78,120,106,84,45,113,82,73,98,78,100,104,71,105,72,107,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
