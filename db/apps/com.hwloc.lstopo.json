It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs.\n\nhwloc primarily aims at helping applications with <b>gathering information about increasingly complex parallel computing platforms so as to exploit them accordingly and efficiently.</b> For instance, two tasks that tightly cooperate should probably be placed onto cores sharing a cache. However, two independent memory-intensive tasks should better be spread out onto different sockets so as to maximize their memory throughput.\n","repo":{"author":"Inria","repo":"https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc"},"usrVersion":"44cfacb1310fcb8053716a81856ef1b9ac40c359088d7962ecf54772a8973026","version":1760079064,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/open-mpi/hwloc","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
