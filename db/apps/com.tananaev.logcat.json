The app uses remote debugging to connect\nto phone local ADB daemon. Configuring remote debugging on a phone can be\nchallenging and requires some technical expertise. It has to be done once and\nafter each device reboot.\n\nEnable USB debugging first on your device. Navigate to Settings > About Phone\nand tap Build number seven times. Go back, access the Developer options menu and\ncheck USB debugging option.\n\nNext step is to enable remote debugging. You need to have Android SDK installed\non your computer. Connect your phone via USB cable and run following adb\ncommand:\n\nadb tcpip 5555\n\nDisconnect USB cable before trying to use the app. Some phones have problems\nhandling network ADB connection when they are connected via USB as well.\n\nSometimes establishing connection to ADB hangs and requires killing and\nrestarting the app. It seems to be a problem with ADB daemon itself and not the\napp issue.","repo":{"author":"Anton Tananaev","repo":"https://github.com/tananaev/rootless-logcat"},"version":"b56a164e382996ef306d449c0b3be523feebfb6c5452f1a347e3f70e7d6ddebc","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/tananaev/rootless-logcat","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
