Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friendsâ€”and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right.

All fully free, open source, and community maintained.
