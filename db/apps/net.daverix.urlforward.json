This app makes it possible to create\nfilters that forwards an url to another site.\n\nFor example, say you have a site called \"myexample.com\" that you want to send to\nanother site called \"myshareexample.com\". Choosing \"Url Forwarder\" in the share\nmenu of your browser then lets you pass the current web page you are on to the\nsite you have created a filter for.\n\nThe filters will be displayed in a dialog and just open any app that has an\nintent filter for the url in the filter (normally the browser).","repo":{"author":"David Laurell","repo":"https://github.com/daverix/urlforwarder"},"usrVersion":"a2bd327a42dae4c79ce8b4ecf1a4349e91ddaa015f8675cea18dd05e081b6475","version":1760175415,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/daverix/urlforwarder","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
