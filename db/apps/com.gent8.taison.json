It keeps pace with upstream while experimenting with convenience upgrades and a refreshed look.\n\n• Library navigation – category tabs are hidden by default, replaced with a quick category dropdown inside the toolbar (tabs can still be re-enabled).\n• History scoping – history entries can be limited to the active library category from Settings › Library › Categories.\n• Taison look – a warm default palette unique to this fork, with the legacy blue palette still available as Classic Blue.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison"},"usrVersion":"5474336d3e0a080ea02a67c0db98b6d68179ad4a43f49ca0c2b839c037a0a9c3","version":1763790033,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
