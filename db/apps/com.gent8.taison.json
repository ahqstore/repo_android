It keeps pace with upstream while adding polished quality-of-life upgrades, each chosen to give you more control and oversight without weighing down the interface.\n\n• Library navigation – Category tabs are hidden by default in favor of a quick toolbar dropdown, and you can switch back to tabs.\n• History scoping –  Library entries are scoped to their respective categories. The History tab includes its own category navigation, and the active category stays in sync between Library and History.\n• Taison look – A distinct, warm palette unique to this fork.\n\nMore Taison features:\n\n• History category navigation mirrors the Library tabs/dropdown, syncing category changes across both screens.\n• A History “eye” toggle exposes or hides entries that sit outside your library, entry deletion can now target the current category or do a complete deletion.\n• Routine upstream syncs keep Taison aligned with Mihon fixes, each changelog highlights new fork-specific polishes so you can keep up to date with Taison's progress.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison"},"usrVersion":"d5a533543538abf8fe9b8dcdc98702728a2d7e089cbaf8e73dfab5ba8ec4b61e","version":1764796715,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
