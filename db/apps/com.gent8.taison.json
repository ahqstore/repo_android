It keeps pace with upstream while experimenting with convenience upgrades and a refreshed look.\n\n• Library navigation – category tabs are hidden by default, replaced with a quick category dropdown inside the toolbar (tabs can still be re-enabled).\n• History scoping – history entries can be limited to the active library category from Settings › Library › Categories.\n• Taison look – a warm default palette unique to this fork, with the legacy blue palette still available as Classic Blue.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison"},"usrVersion":"af74530ec023735b948516f7c9ccac7d3b6b8a17b61269019e4c4a0af451ba17","version":1763886212,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Gent8/Taison","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
