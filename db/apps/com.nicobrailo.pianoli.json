Use this app as a\nbaby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from\ndoing anything you may not want. This app will show a small piano a baby\ncan use to explore sounds in a mobile device. At the same time, it will\nblock any naive attempts at closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu\nbuttons will be blocked, and Android's top menu won't be available. This\nensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any actions on\nthe device you may not want.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PianOli"},"version":"89cebebebb7d8f95d59b206826d12db13a28b417bb0b78a19618ebd770a9f530","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PianOli","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
