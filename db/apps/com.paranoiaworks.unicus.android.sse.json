Use the internal database or just copy/paste to/from your favorite applications. A password is set for the current encryption/decryption session, and you may have an unlimited number of passwords for any purpose (notes, emails, social networking, communication with persons A, B, C, …).\n🎥 ~ <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IK9Sxqr0uJU\">text encryption video tutorial</a>\n\n➤ <b>Password Vault:</b> Store and manage all passwords, PINs, and notes in one secure place protected by one master password. Import/Export function is available (compressed, fully encrypted .pwv file format or unencrypted, editable .xml file format).\n\n• Algorithms: Everything is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms: AES (Rijndael) 256bit, RC6 256bit, Serpent 256bit, Blowfish 448bit, Twofish 256bit, GOST 256bit + Threefish 1024bit, SHACAL-2 512bit and Paranoia C4 2048bit (for S.S.E. Pro Version) ciphers are available.\n• Steganography: Text Encryptor contains a steganographic feature (concealing a text within an image - JPG). A steganographic algorithm (F5 algorithm) is used in combination with chosen symmetric cipher algorithm to make a final steganogram (JPEG image).\n• Other Utils: Password Generator, Clipboard Cleaner, Algorithm Benchmark, …\n• Cross-platform desktop versions (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, …) of Text Encryptor and File Encryptor are available on: <a href=\"https://paranoiaworks.mobi\">https://paranoiaworks.mobi</a>\n• Paranoia Text Encryption for iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod) is available.\n• An online (web-based) version of Text Encryptor (AES, client-side JavaScript) is available on: <a href=\"https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi\">https://pteo.paranoiaworks.mobi</a>","repo":{"author":"Paranoia Works","repo":"https://gitlab.com/paranoia-works/secret-space-encryptor-for-android"},"version":"bed50c04c803adca36e7eb67828f28865b0348f65536127fbc5ca74a583478a0","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/paranoia-works/secret-space-encryptor-for-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,112,97,114,97,110,111,105,97,119,111,114,107,115,46,117,110,105,99,117,115,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,115,115,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,65,111,116,48,114,79,87,102,79,51,75,104,122,106,83,105,67,106,117,102,56,57,89,111,75,76,83,120,78,67,74,70,111,67,101,100,68,99,53,83,114,99,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
