Try to destroy your rivals by pushing them into the black void\nand become the true master of balls. Don't forget to make use of the mighty\npower-ups that will appear eventually. And always be aware of the danger that\nyou have to face out there. But remember, you are alone and there is only one\nsurvivor.\n\nGames are played peer-to-peer; so no server is used, but each player needs to be\nin the same network to see each other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls\nshould also run via Bluetooth. For the best game experience, the WiFi needs low\nlatencies. You can also create a Hotspot and let others connect.\n\nThe aim of the game is to bounce the other players out of the field by balancing\nyour device.The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the\ngame starts and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in the desired\nposition, where your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to\nmove your player to a certain direction.\n\nFor physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics\nengine Box2D.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/bkueng/clash_of_balls"},"version":"137ed6f3c06ff2a03a24c428280a635b2299ddcfa9915f476d3f175eb7085ff6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bkueng/clash_of_balls","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
