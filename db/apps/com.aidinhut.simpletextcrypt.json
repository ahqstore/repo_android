It uses AES in GCM mode with no padding for\nencryption. It uses Argon2 and a random Salt to derive a secure key from the\nentered passphrase.\nThis is a very powerful encryption. It also encrypts its settings before storing\nthem on the device.\n\nHowever, the app might be vulnerable to some attacks. Although it is secure\nenough to stand attacks from non-expert crackers, e.g. normal users,\nshould not be used for serious data encryption.\n\n<b>Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x</b>\n\nThe encryption of the settings is changed. The app should be able to detect the\nold settings and upgrade them with the new encryption algorithm. However, it's\na good idea to <b>back-up your passphrase</b>. (Well, it's generally a good idea to\nback-up encryption keys and passwords in a secure place).\n\nIf the app didn't work after upgrade, uninstall and install it again.\n","repo":{"author":"Aidin Gharibnavaz","repo":"https://github.com/aidin36/simpletextcrypt"},"usrVersion":"f73f9747ba35f7ec6f1e3868ab56b45a32344e56898d9bfb62fdf8219ff70e09","version":1764459553,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/aidin36/simpletextcrypt","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
