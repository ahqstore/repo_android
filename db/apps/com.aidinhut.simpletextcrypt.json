It uses AES in CBC mode with PKCS5\npadding for encryption, and uses PBKDF2 with HMAC, SHA1 and a random Salt in\norder to derive a secure key from the entered password. This is a very powerful\nencryption. Also it encrypts its settings before storing them on the device.\n\nHowever, the app itself may not be very secure, and probably vulnerable to some\nattacks. Although it is secure enough to stand attacks from non-expert crackers,\ne.g. normal users, it should not be used for serious data encryption.\n\n<b>Important Note:</b> If you are updating from version 3.X to 4.X, please clean\nyour data after upgrade.
