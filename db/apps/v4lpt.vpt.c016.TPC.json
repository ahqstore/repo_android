This is a classic pomodoro timer (this version: distraction-free). Right now: Alternating sections of 25 and 5 minutes - running in perpetuity (till stop/close app). \nIf you found this app, you know what kind of person you are ;). Hence, there no options at all and you also cannot pause the timer. This is part of the design of this app. Good luck with your endeavours.\n \n<b>Features</b>\n\n- ⚫ Distraction-free: No status or navigation bar, no numbers, no letters - just visual and acoustic feedback of time. \n- 🎶 Sounds: A sound is played each time a new slice/section begins.\n\nGifted to you by Valentin ❤️\n\nTags: Pomodoro timer, procrastination, student, learning, studying, productivity, 'lofi hip hop radio 📚 - beats to relax/study to', work, code, do boring but necessary stuff, paper work, time blindness, special needs, minimal design, one button app\n\n\n","repo":{"author":"Valentin","repo":"https://github.com/v4lpt/TPC"},"version":"38d72c16674a8a89b0bd0e2d72e890c9d548a3514062bf3e1b971481d3a5101c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/v4lpt/TPC","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
