Eylca currently allows to shoot\npictures or to record a video when a motion is detected in what the camera sees.\nThis application is unofficial. It is not an official Panasonic product, and it\nis not approved by or associated with Panasonic in any way. For basic camera\ncontrol over wifi, please use the official app instead.  Please note that it is\nonly tested on the FZ1000, but it should work on most Lumix cameras.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/mbmb5/Eylca"},"version":"ceb7bbddfeb887f8b9d206697e8a1dce765373c19dfb25a6581b5980a554b4cd","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mbmb5/Eylca","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,109,98,109,98,53,46,108,117,109,105,120,101,120,116,101,110,100,101,100,99,111,110,116,114,111,108,97,112,112,46,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
