A version of the application that is completely open source is available from F-Droid.</p>\n<p>Both versions are available from the <a href=\"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases\">Releases section</a> of the GitHub repository.</p>\n<b>Documentation</b>\n<p>The app&#39;s documentation is available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/blob/master/HELP.md\">HELP.md file</a>.</p>\n<b>License</b>\n<p>VoIP.ms SMS is licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">Apache License 2.0</a>.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Michael Kourlas","repo":"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client"},"version":"88363105eea34e0e27bd99e5571f9d377b9c404c12f583189d50d6d459137ee0","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,110,101,116,46,107,111,117,114,108,97,115,46,118,111,105,112,109,115,95,115,109,115,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,122,54,109,67,114,101,52,55,116,108,108,90,88,118,77,108,113,89,104,120,73,84,118,52,104,104,106,51,56,115,83,99,104,78,74,54,118,110,75,65,110,119,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
