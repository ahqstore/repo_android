The dew point and the absolute water content of the air are\ncalculated automatically. The dew point tells you, at which temperature of e.g.\nsurfaces, walls or window panes condensation starts.  So: Walls which have a\nlower temperature than what the dew point tells you, get wet! Window panes get\nfogged. Make sure, that humidity is sufficient low and the walls are adequately\nwarm.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Taupunkt"},"version":"7b5582c69e84911cb5ac690d7a8e8f63eedbf2a9a610a6cb00efd6eb130c7a1f","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/Taupunkt","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,104,111,102,102,109,97,110,110,115,103,105,109,109,105,99,107,115,116,97,117,112,117,110,107,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,55,77,115,70,48,113,74,100,113,52,66,50,122,101,73,78,97,97,52,48,55,66,111,104,76,118,52,97,121,54,78,82,99,49,121,106,68,69,98,102,80,110,89,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
