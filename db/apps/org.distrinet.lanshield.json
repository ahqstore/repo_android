Some apps misuse this capability to gather data or compromise other devices. LANShield helps you protect your local network by blocking LAN access for apps that don’t need it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n   <li>Block or allow apps from accessing your local network.</li>\n   <li>Gain insights into which apps are interacting with your LAN.</li>\n   <li>Receive notifications when apps attempt to access your LAN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> LANShield uses the VpnService API to create a local virtual VPN interface. It does not establish any external VPN connection.</p>","repo":{"author":"JeroenRobben","repo":"https://github.com/DistriNet/lanshield"},"version":"0dd8f747bdb1adfddfd30f9037e9764ac78b6c7586ee5f0e5c4e5cb6ffc01ed6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/DistriNet/lanshield","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
