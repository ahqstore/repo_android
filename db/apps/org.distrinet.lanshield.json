Some apps misuse this capability to gather data or compromise other devices. LANShield helps you protect your local network by blocking LAN access for apps that don’t need it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n   <li>Block or allow apps from accessing your local network.</li>\n   <li>Gain insights into which apps are interacting with your LAN.</li>\n   <li>Receive notifications when apps attempt to access your LAN.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> LANShield uses the VpnService API to create a local virtual VPN interface. It does not establish any external VPN connection.</p>","repo":{"author":"JeroenRobben","repo":"https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/distrinet/research/netsec/lanshield"},"version":"d241ac7e6dbeaa741ac4ef5b9322e9b3e358c9c0123f00414c14bbbedf634ac9","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/distrinet/research/netsec/lanshield","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
