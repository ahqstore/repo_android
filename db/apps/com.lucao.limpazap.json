It keeps the last one and up to 7 backups prior to it. Why? I don't know. When I run out of space the first thing I do is delete these old backups and that's what this application is for.\n\nThe big letters were a feedback received by potential users who no longer have such a good view.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Lucas Eduardo","repo":"https://github.com/lucasew/limpazap"},"version":"b5ac2f0ec1e245d3859f8c4c8a6c921e03cb3cb2ff05eacc0b86b2cdad04817e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/lucasew/limpazap","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,108,117,99,97,111,46,108,105,109,112,97,122,97,112,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,107,82,112,78,77,49,111,101,122,75,66,105,120,73,103,118,88,88,72,95,56,101,75,89,103,121,88,90,122,116,85,120,120,117,55,120,83,53,101,81,113,110,107,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
