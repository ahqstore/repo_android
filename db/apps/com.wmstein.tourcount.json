It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount"},"version":"8cd82752da493c8b9a4b9d712c809d5e0a5c093d88c8fd6b84259a15a8c47baf","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
