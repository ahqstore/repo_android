It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterflies.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount"},"usrVersion":"53222de44434e8ad4ed0d32e6925b513bc4e32871ae2e85cd58dc410ea510a0b","version":1768678644,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
