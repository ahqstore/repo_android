It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount"},"version":"b818361c0ff8da8e2c161796fb8e9e9fab50700df030f5ccde2cbe2e6e8ee353","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,119,109,115,116,101,105,110,46,116,111,117,114,99,111,117,110,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,67,56,117,83,73,98,99,53,89,115,66,112,52,54,89,101,107,103,79,87,52,79,87,84,85,107,77,83,76,56,97,71,112,107,109,100,97,74,51,51,73,76,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
