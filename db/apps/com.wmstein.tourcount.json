It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.\n\nBoth apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.\n","repo":{"author":"Wilhelm Stein","repo":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount"},"usrVersion":"94fd24fcfc9db75e211597af394573237660d17de67853d328699f31459d9397","version":1763156355,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/wistein/TourCount","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
