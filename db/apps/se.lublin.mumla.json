Host or connect to one of the many community run public servers (see https://www.mumble.info). Mumla is an updated and maintained version (a fork) of the app Plumble.\n\nSome of the features:\n\n* Certificate generation, import and export\n* Browse public servers\n* Voice activated transmission (the default), or different Push-to-talk buttons\n* Bluetooth headset support\n* Self-registration on server\n* Access tokens\n* Opus, CELT, and Speex codec support\n* Automatic reconnection\n* Tor support through the Orbot app\n* Text-to-speech for messages (turned on by default)\n* Light and dark theme\n\nVoice activated transmission currently works best when using a headset. Echo cancellation and noise reduction needs work.\nTweaking the Detection threshold in the settings helps.\n\nMumla is copylefted libre software.
