All you need to do is press the buttons in the right order. It's harder than it looks.</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Background</b><br/>\n    The chimp test, also known as the Ayumu memory test, is a test designed to assess working memory.<br/>\n    It was popularized by a study conducted at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, where chimpanzees demonstrated remarkable short-term memory abilities.<br/>\n    Chimps seem to, effectively, have a photographic memory (eidetic memory).\n    <br/>\n    Untrained humans generally perform significantly worse than chimpanzees on the chimp test. So, this app trains you. The hope is that we can eventually match or beat chimp records.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Gameplay</b>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Numbers from 1 to 9 are displayed randomly</li>\n        <li>You must memorize the positions of the numbers</li>\n        <li>Once you press <b>1</b>, all buttons display a <b>?</b></li>\n        <li>You need to then use your memory to press <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>,..., <b>9</b></li>\n        <li>It's game over if you press the wrong button thrice.</li>\n    </ul>\n</p>","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev/Eidetic-Memory-Trainer"},"version":"cb499aa4ee6d3a58eda0cef4c589e7dd73a0b4412f23a29cb691a87c216a8307","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/hathibelagal-dev/Eidetic-Memory-Trainer","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,111,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,104,97,116,104,105,98,101,108,97,103,97,108,46,101,105,100,101,116,105,99,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,111,121,112,52,81,73,53,108,107,110,88,100,109,102,100,72,51,52,57,87,54,106,117,100,55,87,79,56,109,122,97,73,50,95,100,77,69,97,80,48,74,104,99,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
