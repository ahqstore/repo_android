Make sure your handset runs a recent OxygenOS / ColorOS build or another\n   up-to-date Android ROM.\n2. Install the APK (or via F-Droid once this package is published).\n3. Launch and grant the requested permissions.\n4. (Optional) Grant root to unlock advanced metrics.\n5. (Optional) To make the monitor service work as intended, disable battery optimisation for\n   PlusPlusBattery and, on ColorOS 15, enable “Auto-launch”.\n6. (Optional) For non-Oppo/OnePlus/Realme devices, you may want to disable the option 'Show OPlus exclusive entries' to hide those useless data under root mode.\n\n───────────────────\n■  PRIVACY & OPEN SOURCE\n───────────────────\nThere are **no ads, no trackers, no internet permissions**.\n• Application source code ─ MIT Licence\n• Material Icons (Google Fonts) ─ Apache Licence 2.0\n\nSee the LICENSE and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES files in the repository for full texts.\n\nSpecial thanks to github user @shminer for the original FCC/SOH compensation research and\nalgorithm contributions.\n\nGitHub  ➜  https://github.com/dijia1124/plusplusbattery\nIssues  ➜  https://github.com/dijia1124/plusplusbattery/issues\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/dijia1124/plusplusbattery"},"version":"32d4f21d627896204375fb313bc04090d2a10f73beec5a379a8e197ce2f5813c","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dijia1124/plusplusbattery","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
