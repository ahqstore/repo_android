It's secure and respects your privacy, not sharing your documents with anyone else. It's also available for Android in a simplified form, to view documents in these formats:\n\n* Open Document Format (odt, ods, odp, odg)\n* Microsoft Office 2007–365 (docx, xlsx and pptx)\n* Microsoft Office 97–2003 (doc, xls and ppt)\n\nLibreOffice Viewer also has experimental editing features, which are not yet suited to production use. (Experimental mode can be enabled in the app settings.)\nThe software is open source and made by a worldwide community, so if you'd like to improve the experimental editing support, please join us!\n\nFeedback and bug reports are very welcome, to help developers improve the quality of the application. You can report bugs and attach files here:\n<a href=\"https://bugs.documentfoundation.org\">https://bugs.documentfoundation.org</a>\n\nLibreOffice Viewer is built on the same technology as LibreOffice desktop for Windows, macOS and Linux. LibreOffice Viewer is released under the Mozilla Public License v2. The software is backed by a dynamic community, represented by The Document Foundation, a not for profit entity based in Germany.\n\nLibreOffice was based on OpenOffice.org (commonly known as OpenOffice).\nFull credits: https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/credits","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://git.libreoffice.org/core"},"version":"9d49715da69fd85e85943bf365b95104b7eda4fb0395ad3a77dd5c6134c32a72","site":null,"source":"https://git.libreoffice.org/core","license_or_tos":"MPL-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,102,111,117,110,100,97,116,105,111,110,46,108,105,98,114,101,111,102,102,105,99,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,101,114,87,114,117,51,90,69,122,121,55,77,107,118,69,78,56,48,52,50,115,114,78,80,106,100,52,73,70,70,83,88,97,111,110,84,117,67,71,71,101,118,81,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
