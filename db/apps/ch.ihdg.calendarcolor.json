Tested with\ncalendars provided by baikal.\n\n<b>Kown Issues:</b>\n\nThe color is slightly different from what the google calendar app is showing.\nThe google calendar app seems to tweak the colors a little bit. Colors set in\nowncloud are also slightly different in the google calendar app.\n\nThe colorchanges back after some time: Many calendar services will overwrite the\ncolor when syncing. Set the color directly in the service (e.g. google,\nowncloud) instead.\n\n<b>Thanks:</b>\n\nHoloColorPicker - <a href=\"https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker\">https://github.com/LarsWerkman/HoloColorPicker</a>\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/pascalfree/calendar-color"},"version":"8caf4b679367331c2a8bf20c0216a634218a6d1cbc0e3d59eee9ec8eb345d917","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pascalfree/calendar-color","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
