This means you cannot use PIN-protected passkeys or discoverable credentials with NFC security keys — you're limited to basic U2F tap-to-authenticate. Authnkey fills this gap by implementing the full CTAP2 protocol.\n\nThe app registers as a credential provider, so any app or browser that supports the Android Credential Manager API will offer Authnkey as an option when passkeys are requested.\n\nThis also works on devices without Google Play Services, since Authnkey implements the CTAP2 protocol directly rather than relying on Google's FIDO2 API.\n\nSupported features:\n- Passkey creation and authentication\n- PIN verification\n- Discoverable credentials\n- Multiple accounts per site\n- NFC and USB transports\n\nNo root required.\n","repo":{"author":"Michel Le Bihan","repo":"https://github.com/mimi89999/Authnkey"},"usrVersion":"c8134d4515ab5f10626fd8848cd430b8bd27b86886bc55d095d484d230e61d9b","version":1765927138,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mimi89999/Authnkey","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
