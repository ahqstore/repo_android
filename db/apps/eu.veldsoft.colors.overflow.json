Each cell may contain\na piece of size one, two or three. Initially each player has three pieces in\nsize two. The players take turns to select one of their own pieces to be\nincreased one in size. If a size three piece is selected, it will \"overflow\",\nwhich means that it will be split into four small pieces, which are then\ndistributed to the neighbor cells (left, right,up, down). If a neighbor is also\na size three piece, it will also \"overflow\". Thus you can get rather long chain\nreactions.\n\nThe opponents pieces can only be taken by \"overflowing\" your own pieces into\nthem. If one of your pieces is distributed to a cell occupied by one of the\nopponent's pieces, that piece changes color and is increased by one in size.\nThat way you can win an entire chain of the opponent's pieces in one move, if\nyou play wisely. Pieces that falls off the edge of the board are lost. Don't\nworry too much about this though, the game is not about having many pieces, just\nabout having ALL the pieces ;-)\n\nThe winner in the game is the player who captures all the pieces on the board.\nAlthough the rules are very simple, the game is not easy to play at all. There\nare a lot of tips and tricks to learn.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/ColorsOverflow"},"version":"607fab361d4f95fa139a46fc03c900af9edc4ecf65c58df5b6d1f6b2ed16f5d6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/ColorsOverflow","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,101,117,46,118,101,108,100,115,111,102,116,46,99,111,108,111,114,115,46,111,118,101,114,102,108,111,119,46,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
