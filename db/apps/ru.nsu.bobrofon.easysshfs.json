Password-protected keys are not supported.\nRooted device required (/dev/fuse in android is not allow for users except root).\n\nApplication source code: https://github.com/bobrofon/easysshfs\n\nWARNING:\nIf you just want to have access to the files on your PC from your Android phone, then sshfs is a\nVERY bad solution for that problem. You really need to know some internal details about Android\nstorage implementation to make something useful with sshfs. And EasySSHFS is not intended to hide\nall these details from its users. Please try to use any implementation of Android document provider\nfor sftp protocol (or any other solution to work with sftp) before trying to use sshfs.\n\nNOTE:\n- If you are using SuperSu to manage root access and have no effect after mounting done, try to disable \"mount namespace separation\" option in SuperSU.\n- It is highly recommended to create mount points in /data/media/0 on Android 4.2 and /mnt/runtime/default/emulated/0 on Android 6.0 and above.\n","repo":{"author":"Sergey Bobrenok","repo":"https://github.com/bobrofon/easysshfs"},"usrVersion":"f193bd08378e80dfcb35eef158bc3485f3b2325a82ca70a6eb7c340be5227184","version":1765323510,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/bobrofon/easysshfs","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
