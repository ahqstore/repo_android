This allows the GPS to usable at key moments instead of potentially waiting minutes for the GPS to lock. The app was tested with Android 4.4, 9, and 13. The app targets Android 3-13. The app is very light weight and uses no external libraries.\n\nI made this app because previously I was using an adware app from Google Play and I could not find anything that does this in F-Droid.\n","repo":{"author":"Johannes Fritz","repo":"https://github.com/MrRar/gps_locker"},"version":"88b1310c94d5e8c0e9992388789bce8d02fa71ba5610487749ea93af32071fec","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/MrRar/gps_locker","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,109,114,114,97,114,46,103,112,115,95,108,111,99,107,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,81,109,113,106,102,119,102,86,53,86,104,108,52,74,45,116,67,109,74,69,104,67,90,122,88,95,89,116,87,68,76,101,102,84,71,102,70,77,117,90,88,100,52,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
