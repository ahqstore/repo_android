Open this app and tap on the floating button to grant notification policy access\n2. Return to this app and tap on the floating button again to enable accessibility service\n3. Enjoy!\n\nHow it works:\n\nThis app uses accessibility service to monitor the app that you're currently using, the mechanism is not perfect as Android feeds weird event to the accessibility service in some circumstances.\n\nNote. There's no network related code in this app, in other words, your privacy don't get violated with this app.","repo":{"author":"dic1911","repo":"https://github.com/dic1911/android_AutoDND"},"version":"50747433374062da8b169031130e6afa71559a46bd533f4ebae28b6fed06d737","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dic1911/android_AutoDND","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,109,111,101,46,100,105,99,49,57,49,49,46,97,117,116,111,100,110,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,83,49,52,106,78,116,90,80,105,84,82,86,86,72,52,86,54,118,52,50,88,45,51,78,86,70,57,121,82,75,109,102,111,99,75,78,84,116,120,102,107,114,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
