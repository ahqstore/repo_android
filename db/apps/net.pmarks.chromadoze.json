It is intended to be used as a\nsleep sound generator. It provides rapid feedback to adjustments in the\nspectrum, and is designed to minimize CPU usage in the steady state.\n\nIt works by running shaped white noise through an Inverse Discrete Cosine\nTransform, generating a few megabytes of distinct audio blocks. The steady-state\nbehavior selects blocks at random, and smoothly crossfades between them","repo":{"author":"Paul Marks","repo":"https://github.com/pmarks-net/chromadoze"},"usrVersion":"79823921cfeb823a750af156d902a067fa013eb404dde7ba44058ac76e8f0e1f","version":1760764621,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/pmarks-net/chromadoze","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
