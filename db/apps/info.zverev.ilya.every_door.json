Just go to a mall, and start Every Door. You'll see mapped shops around you: tap on the checkmark for any that are still there, and add shops that are not on the map. That's the entire process: you can keep your entire town up-to-date thanks to this simple editor.\n\nThere is also a micromapping mode for verifying and adding benches and street lamps. And an entrance mode for adding building attributes and entrances — which are merged automatically into building contours.\n\nEvery Door uses presets and other data from iD editor.\n","repo":{"author":"Ilya Zverev","repo":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door"},"usrVersion":"61cdc951ad69c3965a69a84901589d13d78860cbbd1aa6c2b608d3d4786f4317","version":1763542165,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":null,"verified":false}
