Just go to a mall, and start Every Door. You'll see mapped shops around you: tap on the checkmark for any that are still there, and add shops that are not on the map. That's the entire process: you can keep your entire town up-to-date thanks to this simple editor.\n\nThere is also a micromapping mode for verifying and adding benches and street lamps. And an entrance mode for adding building attributes and entrances — which are merged automatically into building contours.\n\nEvery Door uses presets and other data from iD editor.\n","repo":{"author":"Ilya Zverev","repo":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door"},"version":"f04e1f0b53c3ecbe3fd51a2765c6ead6927a7c0cb5bba6c71fd928e48c6247a3","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Zverik/every_door","license_or_tos":"ISC","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,110,102,111,46,122,118,101,114,101,118,46,105,108,121,97,46,101,118,101,114,121,95,100,111,111,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,83,68,112,112,119,89,105,118,66,112,74,77,66,73,101,117,56,111,84,90,115,78,89,107,100,88,90,79,54,112,115,90,71,118,57,117,88,113,95,53,79,84,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
