When those\ncards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne, and more cards\nmay be exported.","repo":{"author":"Timothy Bourke","repo":"https://code.launchpad.net/~tbrk/mnemododo/trunk"},"version":"80cc5604661468f80daa583634adb8d0ae99b75cfa2dc38d11cbb41a17fb3111","site":null,"source":"https://code.launchpad.net/~tbrk/mnemododo/trunk","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
