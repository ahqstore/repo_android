When those\ncards have been reviewed, they are imported back into Mnemosyne, and more cards\nmay be exported.","repo":{"author":"Timothy Bourke","repo":"https://code.launchpad.net/~tbrk/mnemododo/trunk"},"version":"80cc5604661468f80daa583634adb8d0ae99b75cfa2dc38d11cbb41a17fb3111","site":null,"source":"https://code.launchpad.net/~tbrk/mnemododo/trunk","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,116,98,114,107,46,109,110,101,109,111,100,111,100,111,46,50,51,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
