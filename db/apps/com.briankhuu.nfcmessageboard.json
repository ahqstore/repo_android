At a minimum you are recommended to use an NTAG216 that gives you\napproximately 800 bytes of writeable memory.\n\nIt also has the advantage of being relatively private means of communicating\n(even if it runs the issue of spoofing), since it is essentially a dead drop\nsystem.\n\nPotential Uses:\n\n* Geo Cache GuestBook\n* Ingress Local Message Store\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Reads Plain Text\n* Write and prepends a message to a Plain Text Tag\n* UTF-8 support, so can show emoticon.\n* Links, email, map address are autolinked","repo":{"author":"mofosyne","repo":"https://github.com/mofosyne/NFCMessageBoard"},"version":"32f824c91957cf05a8337adf833492e35d5d5c5621846e311e872f106f033252","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mofosyne/NFCMessageBoard","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
