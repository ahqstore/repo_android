PDFs, ID copies, class notes, or anything shared with you often get buried in Downloads, WhatsApp or email attachments. \nI built this app as a student who wanted a simple, private way to keep everything organized and easy to access.\n\nWith Dockeep, you can share any file from any app directly into a folder you choose. It’s like a pocket for your files: quick to save, easy to search, and always under your control.\n\nKey features\n- Share files from any app into your own folders\n- Search to find files instantly\n- Keep everything private, local, and ad-free\n\nIt’s free, open-source, and still early, but I’d love to keep improving it with feedback or contributions.\n","repo":{"author":"Matei Grejdan","repo":"https://github.com/mattgdot/Dockeep"},"usrVersion":"dee877bb6789704ff75f1290379c7fee4d77b8de3708b63b7b54637b9cd5388e","version":1767374272,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mattgdot/Dockeep","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
