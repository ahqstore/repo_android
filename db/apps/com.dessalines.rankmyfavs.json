You might keep list(s) that looks like this:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Network (1976)</li>\n\t<li>Lone Star (1996)</li>\n\t<li>Devils (1971)</li>\n\t<li>The Seventh Seal (1957)</li>\n\t<li>... <i>Many more films_h</i></li>\n</ul>\n\nBut how do you rank these?\n\nYou might be tempted to order them by preference, but this could quickly get overwhelming for long lists.\n\nA much easier method is to use <a href=\"https://www.opinionx.co/blog/pairwise-comparison\">pairwise comparisons</a>, which shows you single head-to-head pairs, and has you choose which one you like best.\n\nAfter doing a small number of these matchups, Rank-My-Favs can confidently create a ranked list for you.\n\nUnder the hood, Rank-My-Favs can sort by either the win-rate, or the more advanced Glicko rating system.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/dessalines/rank-my-favs"},"usrVersion":"2e70cbecf178454f194634f6467da7aa4f5a3c35ddc037904135ca4636f0db29","version":1761111749,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/dessalines/rank-my-favs","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
