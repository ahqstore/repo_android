You can use it for public transport tickets, bills, contracts, certificates and any other PDF file.\nThe PDF file has to be imported into the app. Following that, the barcode is displayed in fullscreen, as well as the PDF document itself. That's already it.\n\nCurrently supported barcode formats are:\n- Matrix (2D) codes: QR, Aztec, DataMatrix and PDF417\n- Linear (1D) codes: UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, CODE-39, CODE-93, CODE-128, ITF and Codabar\n\nMore Features\n- Can detect and extract barcodes in PDFs\n- (Optional) fingerprint authentication\n- PDFs can be individually sorted and named\n- PDFs can be opened\n- PDFs can be shared from other apps\n- PDFs can be shared with other apps (indirectly allows printing)\n- Dark Mode support (document stays in original color)\n- Also supports password protected PDFs\n- Two different layouts to choose from\n\nThe \"Pro\" version additionally brings (requires In-App Purchase):\n- Removes \"Get Pro\" banner on various screens\n- Option to invert document colors in dark mode\n- Option to force dark or light theme by overriding system settings\n- Option to show barcodes in half size\n\nWhy does the generated barcode look different from the one in the PDF?\nThe algorithm used for display is different. For reading devices the code is identical.\n\nPrivacy\nThis app values your privacy by being fully open source and working offline. No ads, no tracking.\n\nIssues\nThis is a free-time project of a single developer. Therefore please understand that replies can take a little while.\n","repo":{"author":"Michael Troger","repo":"https://github.com/michaeltroger/pdfwallet-android"},"usrVersion":"4ab58700aba7d9b103ed94a75958f923e7df237811d2d396a0f7ac9b8917fea9","version":1765143430,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/michaeltroger/pdfwallet-android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
