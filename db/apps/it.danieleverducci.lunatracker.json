You get home from the hospital, exhausted, with this little fragile unknown thingy that has no user manual and a single way to let you know something's not ok: crying.\nYou have to react fast, even if it's 4 AM and you have no idea of the reason behind the cries.\n\nThis app is meant to log all the relevant events (diaper change, breastfeeding, baby bottle feeding, etc.), so you can always remember what was done last time and when. It supports syncing the data between different devices (using your WebDAV server for the best privacy) so that when the baby needs attention, the dad can step in, leaving the mom sleeping peacefully.\n\nDedicated to my daughter Luna.\n\n\nA HUGE thanks to all our contributors.
