Configure custom sequences using UDP, TCP, or ICMP packets with support for both IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nKey Features:\n\n• Protocol Flexibility: Create sequences with UDP, TCP, or ICMP packets. Fine-tune parameters including destination ports, inter-packet delays, TTL, Hop Limit, and packet payload data.\n• Automation & Integration: Automatically launch applications (e.g., SSH clients) or open URLs upon a successful knock. Supports integration with other tools via a custom URI scheme for advanced automation.\n• Dual-Stack Support: Full compatibility with IPv4 and IPv6 networks.\n• Quick Access: Utilize home screen shortcuts and a widget for immediate execution of configured sequences.\n• Customization: Adjust the interface with dynamic color themes (Android 12+), custom accents, and light/dark modes. Includes options for improved contrast.\n• Configuration Management: Export and import your knocking sequences for backup or transfer.\n• No Ads, Open Source: A free, transparent application focused on privacy and user control.\n","repo":{"author":"Alexander Yaburov","repo":"https://github.com/impalex/knockonports"},"usrVersion":"6a256b543c1aee6eab17a226d3c7fe3ff8c1db2291807e92746f9fff429ba2f9","version":1768470731,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/impalex/knockonports","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
