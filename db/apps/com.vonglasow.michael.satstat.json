On such phones you will only see one cell under \"GSM\" or \"CDMA\". This is a limitation of the phone's radio firmware, and SatStat has no way of getting more information from the device.\n* Some devices ignore the command to refresh AGPS data. This is a limitation of the GPS driver (which varies from device to device and is usually proprietary). Starting with version 2.0, SatStat has a workaround in place for automatic AGPS updates.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/mvglasow/satstat"},"version":"7caa3c57baaacbbbf5dc6ef62c62bae92495bd6d1ab318ba07f4fe1338b08b04","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/mvglasow/satstat","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,118,111,110,103,108,97,115,111,119,46,109,105,99,104,97,101,108,46,115,97,116,115,116,97,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,111,74,117,86,82,55,121,83,67,66,99,115,116,113,102,73,79,84,70,82,67,75,45,87,45,48,81,88,52,118,53,118,122,87,67,98,115,116,106,107,98,121,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
