It centres around a design of electric circuits and logical chips, evoking the good ol' days of 8 bit micro-processors.\n\nThe attackers in this game are represented as bits and bytes. To defend the cpu against them, the player builds chips in designated slots. These \"towers\" deal damage by operations such as subtraction, right shift, bitwise and, etc. As usual in these games, the chips can be upgraded in strength.\n\nThe game features \"heroes of the information age\": persons that had great influence on the development of modern computers. They come with a short biography und provide global bonuses that make the game considerably easier.\n\nCurrently, there are more than 25 heroes and heroines. The game comes with 32 predefined levels, but it has also an \"endless\" mode with randomly generated levels. Supported languages are English, French, and German.\n","repo":{"author":"ochadenas","repo":"https://github.com/ochadenas/cpudefense"},"version":"a398fdcc714d684e1c2a740000dc069ae61e4bf248d27e213a89888c81801883","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/ochadenas/cpudefense","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
