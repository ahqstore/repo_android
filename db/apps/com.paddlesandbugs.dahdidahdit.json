This app teaches amateur radio enthusiasts how Morse code works and helps them build their speed.\n\nCustom-Tailored Lessons\nYou set your current level of proficiency and what you aim for (e.g. all letters with 20 words per minute). Dahdidahdit guides you from where you are to where you want to be — It teaches you new letters when you are ready and increases your speed when you seem bored. \n\nRequirements\nThe only things you need (other than a phone and the app) are a sheet of paper and a pen. \n\nUsage\nWhen you start the session, Dahdidahdit plays Morse code letters so you can determine which speed you are comfortable with. You jot down the letters you recognized. When the session ends, Dahdidahdit shows you what it sent and you compare notes. Then you tap the button that shows the number of mistakes. \n\nAutomated Curriculum\nWhen you complete enough practice sessions with only a few mistakes, Dahdidahdit starts the next lesson, by introducing a new letter or by increasing the speed.\n\nAdditional Features\n<ul>\n<li>Learning Q-codes</li>\n<li>Sending practice using either an on-screen or an actual paddle connected by USB</li>\n<li>Morse QSOs via internet with Morserino or Dahdidahdit users</li>\n<li>Game: Morse Tennis</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/matthiasjordan/dahdidahdit"},"version":"c6d4c2ff894b2a30c70845323665d5fc0bf2b910339b5135e143232b5caefcb6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/matthiasjordan/dahdidahdit","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,112,97,100,100,108,101,115,97,110,100,98,117,103,115,46,100,97,104,100,105,100,97,104,100,105,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,109,88,99,80,106,114,54,110,100,74,111,55,81,73,70,77,51,55,85,107,89,65,108,110,76,90,107,54,121,80,74,102,110,70,122,57,56,82,88,121,115,72,73,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
