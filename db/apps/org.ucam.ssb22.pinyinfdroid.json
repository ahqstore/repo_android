You can also tap on any word to see an English translation of that word.  Changing the website's layout to add Pinyin is not perfect (some websites work better than others), but it still works a lot of the time.  For privacy, this app does NOT use any third-party server to fetch or process your text: pinyin is added by your device only.  This also means you must be able to fetch the article via your own network connection, or provide the text yourself, before this app can show it.  Can integrate with Pleco or Hanping.  Has 3lines mode (if you must), Bookmarks, Highlighting and PDF export, Change text size across all pages, Dark mode.  Lightweight and some features work on very old devices too.\n","repo":{"author":"Silas S.
