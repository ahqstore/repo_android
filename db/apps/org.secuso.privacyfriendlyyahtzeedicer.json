No permissions\nMost of Gaming Apps in the Google Play Store require additional permissions. E.g. accessing the network or Internet which is mostly used to display advertisement. Some apps have access to GPS or telephony data.\n\n2. No advertisement\nPrivacy Friendly Dice Game completely relinquishes advertisement.
