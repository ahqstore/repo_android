You will have to create an account and just add the api key from the website. (Have tried various leaflet options but none of them worked as intended..)\n\n  FEATURES\n  * No ads (Almost all of the play store ones have ads in them)\n  * FOSS\n  * Clean, fast and lightweight\n\n  HOW TO USE\n  * Just record your screen or take a screenshot to get the photo or video with the overlay.\n","repo":{"author":"MLM Games","repo":"https://github.com/mlm-games/geotag-video-camera"},"version":"b1aa76ebb176c55786d125ac1f6b35a50db0b6577a1d27a2c9215124d5343875","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mlm-games/geotag-video-camera","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
