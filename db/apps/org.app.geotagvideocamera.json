You will have to create an account and just add the api key from the website. (Have tried various leaflet options but none of them worked as intended..)\n\nFEATURES\n\n* No ads (Almost all of the play store ones have ads in them)\n* FOSS\n* Clean, fast and lightweight\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n* Just record your screen or take a screenshot to get the photo or video with the overlay.\n","repo":{"author":"MLM Games","repo":"https://github.com/mlm-games/geotag-video-camera"},"usrVersion":"3d16924df444914ac1195fb4c44ff859abff0944d58d4bfecc4ea3cb8b1013e7","version":1761086345,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/mlm-games/geotag-video-camera","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
