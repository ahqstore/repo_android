It does not use a remote VPN server, instead data is processed locally on the device.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n\n* Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps\n* Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP URL and the remote IP address\n* Inspect HTTP requests and replies thanks to the built-in decoders\n* Inspect the full connections payload as hexdump/text\n* Decrypt the HTTPS/TLS traffic and export the SSLKEYLOGFILE\n* Dump the traffic to a PCAP file, download it from a browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real-time analysis (e.g. Wireshark)\n* Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies\n* Identify the country and ASN of remote server via offline DB lookups\n* On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running\n\nIf you plan to use PCAPdroid to perform packet analysis, please check out <a href='https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/quick_start#14-packet-analysis'>the specific section</a> of the manual.\n\nJoin the PCAPdroid international community on <a href=\"https://t.me/PCAPdroid\">Telegram</a> or on <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#pcapdroid:matrix.org\">Matrix</a>.\n","repo":{"author":"Emanuele Faranda","repo":"https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid"},"usrVersion":"1224d706f6f04b8accccd47bf80bb4b2652b6addeb185a06c752295df96eebf1","version":1761153479,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
