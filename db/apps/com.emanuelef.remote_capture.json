It does not use a remote VPN server, instead data is processed locally on the device.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n\n* Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps\n* Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP URL and the remote IP address\n* Inspect HTTP requests and replies thanks to the built-in decoders\n* Inspect the full connections payload as hexdump/text\n* Decrypt the HTTPS/TLS traffic and export the SSLKEYLOGFILE\n* Dump the traffic to a PCAP file, download it from a browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real-time analysis (e.g. Wireshark)\n* Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies\n* Identify the country and ASN of remote server via offline DB lookups\n* On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running\n\nIf you plan to use PCAPdroid to perform packet analysis, please check out <a href='https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/quick_start#14-packet-analysis'>the specific section</a> of the manual.\n\nJoin the PCAPdroid international community on <a href=\"https://t.me/PCAPdroid\">Telegram</a> or on <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#pcapdroid:matrix.org\">Matrix</a>.\n","repo":{"author":"Emanuele Faranda","repo":"https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid"},"version":"4abb350711666225855e2ca7aaefd250da00cebce93d5bf90f4ac08936b64a1e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,101,109,97,110,117,101,108,101,102,46,114,101,109,111,116,101,95,99,97,112,116,117,114,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,84,74,84,50,53,54,74,95,82,100,52,118,45,54,70,67,111,76,78,122,121,115,45,56,104,107,77,48,110,116,53,97,121,105,112,104,76,115,53,67,69,78,48,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
