It may be less secure because the app might have a known security vulnerability for several days, even if the official app has been patched. It does not have camera capabilities nor location functions. Issues with this version might be raised on https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata for user @muelli\n\n<strong>Joplin</strong> is a note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in <a href=\"#markdown\">Markdown format</a>.\n\nNotes exported from Evernote and other applications <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#importing\">can be imported</a> into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to Markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.). Plain Markdown files can also be imported.\n\nThe notes can be securely <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#synchronisation\">synchronised</a> using <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/#encryption\">end-to-end encryption</a> with various cloud services including Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/plans/\">Joplin Cloud</a>.\n\nFull text search is available on all platforms to quickly find the information you need.
