The game was invented by Wilfrid\nHartnagel. Android application was created by Todor Balabanov.\n\nDepending on where the first figure is placed there can be more than 23000\nopening moves, hence it is most unlikely that a game will ever be played twice.\nPlayers develop their own tactics to win boards and strategies to win the game.\n\nThere are 3 ways to win a board:\n<ol>\n<li>by creating a line of 5 figures that cannot be beaten.</li>\n<li>by beating your opponent's President.</li>\n<li>by reducing the amount of your opponent's figures. When you don't have enough figures left to create a line of five you have lost.</li>\n</ol>\nThe maximum score of a board is 100 points. You need 100 points to win the game.\nYou may win the game by winning several boards or one only.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Politrics"},"version":"7d21fb685026b4d0ce2a1df1412a66df7d9d2efd693cf6a176fdd38fd143d716","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Politrics","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,101,117,46,118,101,108,100,115,111,102,116,46,112,111,108,105,116,114,105,99,115,46,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
