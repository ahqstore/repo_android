Its main objective is to not use the Reddit API directly, but instead use the RSS/JSON feeds to display content. This allows the app to view Reddit without being subject to API limits, changes and problems. Geddit works without a Reddit account, which also means that you can stay anonymous while browsing Reddit, if you are concerned about privacy.\n\nSome of the features of Geddit include:\n\n* View posts, comments, subreddits and users\n* View images, gifs, videos and self posts\n* Access NSFW content\n* View your subscribed subreddits\n* Save photos to your device\n* Share posts\n* Search for posts, subreddits and users\n* Support for app links","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit-app"},"version":"fc5de5320d354a693e443ea609efe3bc63e7cc238147e8127a6989fe108894c4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kaangiray26/geddit-app","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,103,101,100,100,105,116,46,98,117,122,108,46,117,107,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,81,109,112,56,86,57,52,71,73,109,114,79,68,73,102,52,100,116,118,71,84,98,108,67,121,74,107,83,71,51,95,113,106,97,52,122,69,50,85,110,70,122,89,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
