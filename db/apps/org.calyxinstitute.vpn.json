All DNS requests are anonymously handled by Calyx when the VPN is on.\n• Circumvention: When \"Use Bridges\" option is enabled, all your traffic is hidden as normal web traffic, in order to circumvent some censorship systems that block VPN traffic.\n\nAs with all VPNs, CalyxVPN only adds security to your data as it flows over the network. It cannot protect the content of your data that is stored or that you give to a website. It also does not prevent advertising and tracking in your apps or web browser (except when this tracking is based on your IP address).\n","repo":{"author":"Calyx Institute","repo":"https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/bitmask_android"},"usrVersion":"347de07f85fd18eaf66c31ce98338b90500038b50bf0ee2cceefd498cb1f38a6","version":1760685544,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/CalyxOS/bitmask_android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
