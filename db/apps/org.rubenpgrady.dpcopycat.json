However, you might not desire to root your phone, either because it can turn out to be quite difficult to achieve, or because it has numerous disadvantages in itself, anyway.<br />\nAnother option is to connect to the phone via <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tools/adb\">Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</a> and run:<br />\n<blockquote><tt>adb shell dumpsys | sed -n '/^Packages:/,/^[[:space:]]*$/p'</tt></blockquote>\nThe command prints the \"Packages\" section from <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/tools/dumpsys\"><tt>dumpsys</tt></a>, which contains detailed information about every installed package.
