There are two major components of play: a mapping mechanism and a system\nof glyphs, or patterns of orthogonally adjacent squares. The mapping mechanism\nworks as follows. Your last move points to the mini grid in which your next move\nmust be made. For example, if your last move was in the upper left corner of a\nmini grid, then your next move must be made somewhere in the upper left mini\ngrid. The glyph system works as follows. There are 19 named glyphs of various\nsizes from 1 to 9 orthogonally adjacent squares. Glyphs that you form during\nplay are worth points. The majority of points scored in a mini grid wins the\nmini grid. The winner of the majority of mini grids wins the game.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Scribe4"},"version":"3167b5df65d825b5b739fb44d62148ece82f1ec5fa4afb63e91cc509bd8fea8d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/VelbazhdSoftwareLLC/Scribe4","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
