Just heavy-metal Vikings who love to slice seafood!\n\nSlice all the seafood from entering your Viking ship, but don't chop the anchors! It has two modes, \"Classic\" where you lose a life for each missed food, and \"Arcade\" where you just go for points.\n\nI started this game a long time ago as a joke, but illness and family matters eventually made it so I couldn't finish it. So I just cleaned it up a bit and published it because I'm not sure when I'll get back to it! I hope someone can enjoy it!\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/quaap/SeafoodBerserker"},"version":"9c9b55182ec006e08240e0a22df2eee2d11fdaa8cdc3ba2cca1d7d76aca72b50","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/quaap/SeafoodBerserker","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,113,117,97,97,112,46,102,105,115,104,98,101,114,115,101,114,107,101,114,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,79,68,55,83,84,119,84,122,101,52,67,98,105,69,49,121,104,45,72,80,114,87,97,80,74,118,71,55,104,74,102,82,121,53,114,120,120,82,95,115,104,77,115,61,46,106,112,103]},"verified":false}
