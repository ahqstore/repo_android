This app is the entry into the fediverse to communicate with the people you like. koyu.space uses Mastodon and it has some advantages. Instead on relying on a centralized infrastructure, Mastodon relies on a decentralized infrastructure. That's pretty much like E-Mail: You have an e-mail address, but you can also interact with people on other servers. Besides that we have some other features included, that aren't available on Mastodon.\n","repo":{"author":"koyu.space","repo":"https://github.com/koyuspace/android-native"},"usrVersion":"eb669949e7c916a0927bdc8d3ceb9f187f9594f2048a591b4ad39f6a3d537ffa","version":1760588493,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/koyuspace/android-native","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
