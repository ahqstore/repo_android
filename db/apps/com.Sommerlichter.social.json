This app is the entry into the fediverse to communicate with the people you like. koyu.space uses Mastodon and it has some advantages. Instead on relying on a centralized infrastructure, Mastodon relies on a decentralized infrastructure. That's pretty much like E-Mail: You have an e-mail address, but you can also interact with people on other servers. Besides that we have some other features included, that aren't available on Mastodon.\n","repo":{"author":"koyu.space","repo":"https://github.com/koyuspace/android-native"},"version":"eb669949e7c916a0927bdc8d3ceb9f187f9594f2048a591b4ad39f6a3d537ffa","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/koyuspace/android-native","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,83,111,109,109,101,114,108,105,99,104,116,101,114,46,115,111,99,105,97,108,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,57,78,117,120,95,77,115,107,107,86,122,84,100,114,76,51,84,99,70,116,114,118,87,120,52,77,117,112,74,113,102,115,53,66,107,105,107,114,98,122,68,65,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
