Intended\nprimarily for car Bluetooth systems. It can read out text messages using Text To\nSpeech (TTS) services while you are connected. Each paired Bluetooth device or\nvirtual device (home dock, car dock, power connection, or headset plug) can be\nconfigured to your liking. There is a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume/wiki/Manual\">manual</a> on the website.\n\nA secondary feature is the ability to capture location information so you can\nfind where you left your car. The location can also be automatically captured\nwhen exiting Car Mode on your Android device and read by any app that\nunderstands GPS data.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume"},"version":"f67ef52502faf8dbcef310c122d9efe7871effdd8f9fe0ca93b9925513152d37","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,97,50,100,112,46,86,111,108,46,49,54,57,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
