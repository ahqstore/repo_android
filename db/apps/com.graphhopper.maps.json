It calculates routes and alternatives very fast. It supports several modes of transport like car, bike, hiking, walking and more. You can add multiple stops to your route and on bigger screens view the road attributes like elevation, surface or max speed for that route.\n\nRead more: https://www.graphhopper.com/maps-route-planner/\n\nAfter you calculated the route and your GPS location is enabled you can start the GPS navigation which guides you to your destination.
