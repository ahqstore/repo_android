It doesn’t have an opinion on the correct spelling or tone. It certainly doesn’t use any AI. Because it trusts you to write what you meant to write.</p>\n<p>Instead, FlickBoard uses swipes to get away with using vastly fewer (and larger!) buttons than a traditional QWERTY keyboard, helping you build muscle memory, minimize typos, and touch type faster.</p>\n<p>Type the letters in the center of a key by tapping it. Type the keys in the corners by swiping in that direction. It’s that simple!</p>\n<p>FlickBoard is inspired by <a href=\"https://www.exideas.com/ME/index.php\">MessagEase</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key\">Thumb-Key</a>.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Natalie Klestrup Röijezon","repo":"https://codeberg.org/natkr/flickboard"},"version":"f83f2fea2b88bfbede01e61e68515419cfe1411bdae951adc9464c6d4233be1b","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/natkr/flickboard","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,115,101,46,110,117,108,108,97,98,108,101,46,102,108,105,99,107,98,111,97,114,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,77,90,111,88,68,83,115,109,114,115,77,70,98,119,122,56,102,118,117,50,52,114,80,69,106,78,105,97,75,81,86,104,70,107,72,103,90,103,89,51,103,108,77,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
