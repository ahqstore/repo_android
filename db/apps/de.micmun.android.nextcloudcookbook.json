Perhaps at next app start no recipes can be loaded.\nTherefore it is better to use the above mentioned path on the SD card (see First steps).\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://codeberg.org/MicMun/nextcloud-cookbook"},"version":"e6eec9c6527703ca21ec9820adebcbdd3486a7b1443942aff38e4c63ba65f785","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/MicMun/nextcloud-cookbook","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,109,105,99,109,117,110,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,110,101,120,116,99,108,111,117,100,99,111,111,107,98,111,111,107,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,69,66,118,66,53,89,52,87,85,57,119,78,71,74,113,70,84,75,103,52,79,107,112,100,49,68,101,65,69,55,115,86,87,51,69,80,104,83,86,101,48,70,89,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
