Default layouts support Latin- and Cyrillic-based and Greek\ncharacter sets: user-definable external layouts are supported as well. For\nentering a plain character just swipe a key to some direction: for entering some\naccented ones, do a big swipe across the whole keyboard. Depending on the\ndirection of the big swipe, you can choose different sets of accenting. For\nchoosing a different layout, do a big swipe from the top-left corner of the\nkeyboard across to bottom-down, and choose a layout from L0 to L6 (L0:Latin,\nL1:Cyrillic, L2:Greek, L3-L6:Custom). To get a visual feedback about the symbol\nyou are about to enter, visit the entries 'Feedback/Normal feedback' and\n'Feedback/Password feedback' in the Settings menu, and choose either Toast or\nHighlight.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/gsimon75/compass-keyboard"},"version":"897486e1f857c6c0ee32ccbad0e1b8cd82f6d0e65a44a23f13f852d2b63a18c8","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/gsimon75/compass-keyboard","license_or_tos":"BSD-3-Clause","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,100,121,110,100,110,115,46,102,117,108,101,115,46,99,107,46,50,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
