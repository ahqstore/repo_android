It also facilitates tracking. This\napp helps to reduce this by turning off WIFI.\n\nBy default the app only listen to WIFI changes. You need to enable the app\n(checkbox) to activate the turn off WIFI feature. If want to connect to a\nnew (not whitelisted) network, you need to disable the app, scan or connect\nto whitelist the SSID/BSSID, then enable the app again. (Otherwise it would\njust instantly turn off the WIFI.)\n\nThe app only cares whether the SSID/BSSID is among the WIFI scan results, so\nconnection errors does not turn off the WIFI.\n\nThe whitelist, currently connected networks, available networks are color\ncoded (red, green, and gray respectively).\n\nA notification is shown if the app is enabled.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/csmarosi/wifiAutOff"},"version":"d3d95a012eefdd1e88996b95c6eca70c5dfaa1703ed8b81f3a59f9d1011c92a4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/csmarosi/wifiAutOff","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,99,115,109,97,114,111,115,105,46,119,105,102,105,97,117,116,111,102,102,46,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
