If you experience issues or have feature requests, please file an issue (link below).</b>\n\nFrustrated by the lack of free, open-source scientific calculators that feel like the ones I am used to, I decided to reverse-engineer my old calculator from school.\n\nWith features like:\n\n- input of complex equations,\n\n- output as fractions as well as decimals,\n\n- result storage and reuse,\n\n- selection and editing of equations from input history,\n\n- and support for implicit multiplication (like 5π instead of 5*π),\n\nthis calculator produces math that looks like the math on your paper. That makes it much more suitable for higher-level math in school and university—especially if you've grown accustomed to this kind of interface from a young age and just forgot your calculator at home.\n\nSome additional features include:\n\n- A well-established open-source math.js library as the math engine—so you’re not relying on some sketchy, hand-rolled math logic (just my sketchy hand-rolled input method 😛)\n\n- A familiar, intuitive design\n\n- 100% offline usability and fully open source\n\n- Written entirely in HTML, JS, and CSS, which means:\n\n\t+ inherently cross-platform (a Flatpak release is planned)\n\n\t+ easy for other web developers to contribute\n\n\t+ admittedly a bit heavy for a calculator. If you're interested in helping make a lighter version (Flutter, Kotlin, etc.), you're very welcome!","repo":{"author":"Joris Yidong Scholl","repo":"https://github.com/CardiJey/schulrechner"},"version":"a98ee4a833c87db9cdaf855fe1581c5776aeb6a28f507876e628c1953c1c1d47","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/CardiJey/schulrechner","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
