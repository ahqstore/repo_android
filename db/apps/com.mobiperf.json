You can view the data collected that has been collected\nwithin the app.\n\nThe Android app periodically checks in with the measurement server, running on\nGoogle App Engine, which sends it a list of measurement tasks to perform.\nMeasurement tasks include ping, traceroute, HTTP GET, DNS lookup, and TCP\nThroughput. Each task has an associated set of measurement parameters (e.g.,\nwhich host to ping), and a schedule (periodicity at which to take the\nmeasurement).\n\nThe device runs the measurements in the background, and uploads the measurement\nresults on its next checkin cycle. By default, devices check in with the server\nevery hour. In order to avoid draining the battery, the app will not take any\nmeasurements if the battery is below a given threshold (80% by default).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/Mobiperf/MobiPerf"},"version":"233ceb1db946c5ea43ac957b864784b6a56b5351a9135864808fb13b734e249e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Mobiperf/MobiPerf","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,109,111,98,105,112,101,114,102,46,49,48,53,48,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
