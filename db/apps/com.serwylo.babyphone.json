Do they get sad when there is nobody free to speak with them?\n\nInstall this pretend phone app to let them listen and speak to another toddler at the other end of the phone babbling back to them.\n\nStill in early stages of development. Some ideas for future improvements include:\n* Record your own audio so your little ones can hear loved ones from their real family.\n* Interactively listen to the microphone and only babble back when there is a period of silence.\n* Interact with other phone buttons, such as the dial pad, mute button, etc.\n\nPlease support further development at GitHub sponsors or Liberapay.\n","repo":{"author":"Peter Serwylo","repo":"https://github.com/babydots/babyphone"},"usrVersion":"27848666aa65867f11754395a1f00ab70983b2cff6904282c688cd5709cf9e47","version":1760460417,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/babydots/babyphone","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
