This app is the barcode decoder (receiver). An encoder (sender) can be seen at <a href='https://cimbar.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar.org</a>.\n\nWith <i>CameraFileCopy</i> it is possible to receive data over the camera as a one-way data channel. It does not use any antennas (wifi, bluetooth, nfc, ...) or other tricks. Notably, this means it works just as well in airplane mode.\n\nThe app reads animated <a href='https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar codes</a>. Nearly all the interesting logic is from libcimbar – included via a git subtree. The sender component of cfc is a cimbar encoder -- such as <a href='https://cimbar.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar.org</a>. Navigate to that website (or use libcimbar's <code>cimbar_send</code> to generate barcodes natively), open a file to initialize the cimbar stream, and point the app+camera at the animated barcode.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/sz3/cfc"},"version":"30c08e4d62c8480c416b76be24dfa848e7cf89679d1d69cf7fc7250f04255b97","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sz3/cfc","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,99,105,109,98,97,114,46,99,97,109,101,114,97,102,105,108,101,99,111,112,121,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,69,89,82,104,87,108,67,79,51,116,50,114,52,65,112,90,100,74,70,51,114,122,45,100,115,50,109,82,76,81,99,77,56,79,112,112,81,110,50,71,88,108,89,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
