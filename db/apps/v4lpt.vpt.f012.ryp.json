That way you can change your rating or skip rating a picture.\n\n<b>Features:</b>\n\n* ‚≠ê <b>Rating Overlay</b> - Hold any picture for half a second to toggle overlay mode. In this mode, your rating is displayed over the picture for one-sixth of a second after each rating. You can disable this feature for faster rating.\n* üóëÔ∏è <b>Delete 0 Star Pictures</b> - 0 Star Pictures are only deleted when you pause the app, close it, or press the button that takes you to the welcome screen. Until then, you can undo the ratings.\n* ‚òï <b>Contemplative Loading</b> - Our state-of-the-art image loading process takes just long enough for you to ponder the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
