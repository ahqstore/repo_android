Images\nwill scroll all the way from one end to another as you move between home\nscreens. Images with a taller aspect ratio than your screen will scroll\nvertically.\n\n<b>Notes</b>\n\nImages are loaded at their original resolution, and large images may cause the\napp to run out of memory and crash. Consider reducing the size of large images.\n\nSome launchers don't scroll the wallpaper all the way to the end when there are\nonly a few screens. This is an issue with the launcher itself and there is\nnothing that I can do about it.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/danielmeek32/FlexibleWallpaper"},"version":"e680c0a6b8ed7291a580def660228b2bf647ad7b5a807bdb8fcb4df4d9445227","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/danielmeek32/FlexibleWallpaper","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,97,110,105,101,108,95,51,50,46,102,108,101,120,105,98,108,101,119,97,108,108,112,97,112,101,114,46,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
