We'd love you to try it and tell us what you think.  You'll need to buy an inexpensive ($30ish) radio from a variety of vendors to use this application, see our website for details.  We don't make these devices.\n\n***Please*** if you encounter problems or have questions: post on our forum at https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic/discussions and we'll work together to fix them (we are volunteer hobbyists).  We would really appreciate good Google reviews if you think this is a good project.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android"},"version":"96b705801ae8a839cdd8f6dd1641d62f6cd5f05e9a38834b4cc9769904b6bbe6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
