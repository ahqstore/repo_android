We'd love you to try it and tell us what you think.  You'll need to buy an inexpensive ($30ish) radio from a variety of vendors to use this application, see our website for details.  We don't make these devices.\n\n***Please*** if you encounter problems or have questions: post on our forum at https://github.com/orgs/meshtastic/discussions and we'll work together to fix them (we are volunteer hobbyists).  We would really appreciate good Google reviews if you think this is a good project.\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android"},"version":"0dc51bdb7c02d74fde4a3be82e6c5f41edca992e7381acadf6cd417a6e83504f","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-Android","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,103,101,101,107,115,118,105,108,108,101,46,109,101,115,104,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,116,90,100,56,104,53,114,103,48,85,103,110,65,81,76,105,52,87,56,95,110,82,119,97,76,83,112,88,90,80,100,119,71,65,45,120,116,108,73,112,76,73,56,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
