Tired of hopping back to your home screen to\nlaunch that one app while you are inside another one? Have you used a side\nlauncher and\n\n* are frustrated because you have to do multiple gestures to launch the app?\n* activate it accidentally by touching the activation zone and immediately launch the app that happens to be on that spot?\n* do you miss the ability to define a folder structure in that launcher?\n\nThen PaperLaunch is the perfect side launcher for you. Try it!\n\nPaperLaunch is open source! You can find it on GitHub.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/devmil/PaperLaunch"},"version":"62ee5ab2134fc02938d187d7865faa4386dd2e5d8fd10800119837f4a0679182","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/devmil/PaperLaunch","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,100,101,46,100,101,118,109,105,108,46,112,97,112,101,114,108,97,117,110,99,104,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,82,98,80,54,103,82,80,49,89,107,108,100,69,82,66,98,73,78,50,54,112,75,120,111,79,102,51,97,85,101,101,118,106,83,110,100,74,51,101,55,106,77,85,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
