Tired of hopping back to your home screen to\nlaunch that one app while you are inside another one? Have you used a side\nlauncher and\n\n* are frustrated because you have to do multiple gestures to launch the app?\n* activate it accidentally by touching the activation zone and immediately launch the app that happens to be on that spot?\n* do you miss the ability to define a folder structure in that launcher?\n\nThen PaperLaunch is the perfect side launcher for you. Try it!\n\nPaperLaunch is open source! You can find it on GitHub.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/devmil/PaperLaunch"},"usrVersion":"0767518f0921bdcb29da817dc99c212cf148ee36a90a448b78cb4e7a38c5781c","version":1760603192,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/devmil/PaperLaunch","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
