If you're using the floating button don't trigger a translation if sensitive data is located in the system clipboard.</b>\n\nTips and Tricks:\n- If an app has implemented a custom context menu see if the floating button works for you or if the app is able to share text\n- Integration into \"Librera\" (FOSS ebook reader):\n   1. Select any word in the document by long-pressing it (text selection must be supported by the document)\n   2. In the opening dialog tap the \"+\" sign at the bottom and select InstaLate\n   3. Next time you select text you'll have access to the InstaLate button at the bottom\n\nThanks:\nTo all translation providers and their awesome services this application would be nothing without (in alphabetical order):\n- Beolingus: https://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/\n- DeepL: https://www.deepl.com/\n- Dict. cc: https://www.dict.cc/\n- GNU CIDE: https://gcide.gnu.org.ua/\n- Heinzelnisse: https://www.heinzelnisse.info/\n- LibreTranslate: https://translate.argosopentech.com/\n- Linguee: https://www.linguee.com/\n- WikDict: https://www.wikdict.com/\n- Wiktionary: https://wiktionary.org/\n","repo":{"author":"Concept1tech","repo":"https://gitlab.com/concept1tech/instalate"},"version":"ba89b90e339af2e75f42729244f612edf891b2433881e68d9646e5e1a0ed16e5","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/concept1tech/instalate","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,99,111,110,99,101,112,116,49,116,101,99,104,46,105,110,115,116,97,108,97,116,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,98,95,83,48,54,75,49,88,78,118,72,95,45,121,116,74,75,105,113,78,89,54,118,53,115,122,108,83,48,100,97,114,67,102,50,95,84,103,109,106,122,57,69,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
