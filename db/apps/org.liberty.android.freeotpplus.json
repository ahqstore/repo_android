This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary: use any server-side component that implements these standards â€” for example FreeIPA, which uses TOTP.\nAny standards-compliant implementation will work.\nCurrently, FreeOTP provides implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus"},"version":"6ffa77a9cd2e463866ce14800adffc47c0ad0f600746064e0bbf1e72dde973e7","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/helloworld1/FreeOTPPlus","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,97,115,115,101,116,115,47,105,99,95,114,101,112,111,95,97,112,112,95,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,95,75,78,78,48,48,56,90,50,75,55,86,78,80,90,79,70,76,77,84,114,121,51,74,107,102,70,89,80,120,86,71,68,111,112,83,49,105,119,87,101,53,119,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
