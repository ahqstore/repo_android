The app will open showing the compression progress and when it's done a new share dialog will reappear with the new compressed file.\n\n<b>Split APKs</b>\nThe APK downloaded from F-Droid is the app full version with all features and abi compatibility included. A choice of smaller APKs can be found at https://github.com/caydey/ffshare/releases\n\n<b>Source Code</b>\nThis app is open source and hosted on GitHub. A star would be greatly appreciated.\nhttps://github.com/caydey/ffshare\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/caydey/ffshare"},"version":"97e1eb5b046f3d4bac83a5935afd6fb9595866f5136925041ef817c0cc06fe53","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/caydey/ffshare","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,99,111,109,46,99,97,121,100,101,121,46,102,102,115,104,97,114,101,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,118,118,80,89,102,81,54,89,86,50,122,100,57,121,100,104,115,86,88,97,108,86,109,99,53,77,90,90,76,90,80,95,108,122,50,52,107,102,97,84,75,69,81,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
