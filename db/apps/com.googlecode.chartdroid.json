ChartDroid is an\nIntent-based \"library application\" for static chart and graph generation on\nAndroid. Other applications can use it to graph/plot/display numerical data in\nmany representations by implementing a ContentProvider according to this simple\n[specification](https://code.google.com/archive/p/chartdroid/wikis/InterfaceSpecification.wiki).\n\nChartDroid is consistent with the \"Unix toolkit\" philosophy of building small,\ninteroperable tools. Having ChartDroid exist as an independent application\n(as against being an importable .jars library) conserves storage space and\neliminates redundant code.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/kostmo/chartdroid"},"version":"e5838e1f325d9007679ff9051d95ac4f501a210d4ae4ebefe94e6b3da9158794","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/kostmo/chartdroid","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
