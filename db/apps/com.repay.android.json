With Repay you can keep track of\neverything you've lent them, and what they've lent you too using a simple, fast\nsystem to store an IOU in your device so you never forget. There's no need to\nmake any accounts or give any bank account information, it's just a simple\nrecord you keep to make sure you're never out of pocket.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/matt-allen/repay-android"},"version":"9f49d12248bc0a43384b55d135bd85e1746304b42db779216f307c8700353459","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/matt-allen/repay-android","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,114,101,112,97,121,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,50,53,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
