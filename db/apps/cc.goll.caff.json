The tile also serves as a countdown timer when caffeine is enabled.\nBy long-pressing it, a preferences menu is shown, allowing the user to choose which durations will be cycled through.\nAdditionally, there is an \"infinite\" mode, which will keep the display on indefinitely.\n<p><b>Note</b></p>\nYou may have to disable battery optimizations for the app to work.\n","repo":{"author":"goll","repo":"https://github.com/goll72/caff"},"usrVersion":"41b0e2c5bee84117f85a75d4099a0030d2f89bdd158e50011634f0f91c608e12","version":1768649934,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/goll72/caff","license_or_tos":"BSD-2-Clause","resources":null,"verified":false}
