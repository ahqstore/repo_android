For more information on Recoll, see\nhttps://www.recoll.org\n\nRecollDroid consists of an andriod ui and a thin server layer providing a RestAPI interface\nto the Recoll software.  It uses Recoll's python API and supports multiple users securely\nvia basic auth over https.\n\nThe server layer makes use of FastAPI to provide the restful endpoints for the UI.  It\ncontains no authentication code itself but depends on a proxying layer to ensure only\nvalidated users can connect.  The supported setup is to use the Nginx reverse proxy to\nperform basic auth together with the unit app server to host the recoll rest api.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/gbygrave/recolldroid"},"version":"6baf6691b61d849252abd72cafb24f4630e2b3a11b9df5f9bb9f9b1b8f5f47b7","site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/gbygrave/recolldroid","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,103,114,97,116,105,110,103,46,114,101,99,111,108,108,100,114,111,105,100,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,112,80,84,68,87,70,95,66,90,95,88,76,95,53,72,77,55,105,100,72,87,89,106,73,95,49,100,117,79,102,104,90,118,55,106,98,79,110,73,122,80,112,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
