That way\n  your Gallery is not suspiciously empty.\n\nPrivacy Policy: We collect nothing.","repo":{"author":"Wavesonics","repo":"https://github.com/SecureCamera/SecureCameraAndroid"},"usrVersion":"c7c85838a5dcc37a6ebf2b9a0327706fbd27158b20dcc11e1721f56b3e8437e9","version":1761121687,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecureCamera/SecureCameraAndroid","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
