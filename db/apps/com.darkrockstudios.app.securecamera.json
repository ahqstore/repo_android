That way\n  your Gallery is not suspiciously empty.\n\nPrivacy Policy: We collect nothing.","repo":{"author":"Wavesonics","repo":"https://github.com/SecureCamera/SecureCameraAndroid"},"version":"34f30554935765986a42dbc2754c62b2e47b5571bacc17e1c610e5b96496d5b4","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/SecureCamera/SecureCameraAndroid","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
