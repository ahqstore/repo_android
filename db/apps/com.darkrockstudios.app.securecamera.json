That way\n  your Gallery is not suspiciously empty.\n\nWhy Snap Safe?\nWe capture photos locally, encrypt everything in private storage, let YOU decide if GPS tags are added (precision optional), and strip out tell‑tale metadata automatically.\n\nWe NEVER phone home or talk to servers, slurp analytics or usage stats, sprinkle ads or trackers in the code, or read files outside our sandbox.\n\nPrivacy Policy: We collect nothing.","repo":{"author":"Wavesonics","repo":"https://github.com/Wavesonics/SecureCamera"},"version":"9c593d1e3006bfd96b8a3c3b9d6e082edeb261d9141c8d2d3f5160e9b49b3b8b","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/Wavesonics/SecureCamera","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
