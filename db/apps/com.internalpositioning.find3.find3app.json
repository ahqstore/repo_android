This app will allow you to use\nyour phone to perform constant scans of Bluetooth and WiFi signals and levels\nthat can be associated with certain locations in your home to allow internal\npositioning. To receive the data, the <a href=\"https://github.com/schollz/find3\">FIND3\npublic server</a> can be used or a personal server can be deployed.\n\nThe Framework for Internal Navigation and Discovery (FIND) is like GPS, but for\nyour every room in your house/business, with using only a simple smartphone or\nlaptop.\n\nYour device (laptop or a smartphone) tracks itself by actively scanning for\nnearby Bluetooth/WiFi devices and records their signal strengths and\nclassifying them based on known signal strengths for a given location.\n\nThis repository is a complete re-write of the [github.com/schollz/find previous\nversion of FIND]. The API for sending fingerprints (/track and /learn) is\nbackward compatible. There are several notable improvements on the previous\nversion:\n\n* Support for any data source, Bluetooth / WiFi / magnetic fields / etc. (previously just WiFi)\n* Passive scanning built-in (previously required a separate server)\n* Support for Bluetooth scanning in scanning utility (previously just WiFi)\n* Meta-learning with 10 different machine learning classifiers (previously just three)\n* Client uses Websockets+React which reduces bandwidth (and coding complexity)\n* Rolling compression of mac addresses for much smaller on-disk databases (see mapslimmer)\n* Data storage in SQLITE-database (previously it was BoltDB)","repo":{"author":"Hypercube Platforms","repo":"https://github.com/schollz/find3-android-scanner"},"version":"1b61fb3f2326032020e2e1f86928d04d3e2e9f3ae32007edfc0d024bf0624405","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/schollz/find3-android-scanner","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,105,110,116,101,114,110,97,108,112,111,115,105,116,105,111,110,105,110,103,46,102,105,110,100,51,46,102,105,110,100,51,97,112,112,46,54,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
