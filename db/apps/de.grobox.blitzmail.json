This\ncomes in handy when you need to send a lot of things via email, because you are\nin a low connectivity area (e.g. subway) and want to remember things to look at\nlater.\n\nIt also works when you are offline. BlitzMail then queues your emails and allows\nyou to send them later when you have connectivity again.\n\nThe SMTP password is stored encrypted with a built-in key and salted with your\ndevice ID. This is not fully secure, but should provide reasonable protection\nfor your password.","repo":{"author":"Torsten Grote","repo":"https://github.com/grote/BlitzMail"},"version":"9c84aae9cba2be9d95dd836a151c6821ceddce5d148eb690c130006a13504b39","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/grote/BlitzMail","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,100,101,46,103,114,111,98,111,120,46,98,108,105,116,122,109,97,105,108,46,49,52,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
