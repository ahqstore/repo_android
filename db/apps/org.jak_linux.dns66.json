The newer https://f-droid.org/packages/dev.clombardo.dnsnet/ continues development.\n\nDNS66 allows blocking host names via DNS. This can be used for ad blocking. It\nalso allows other DNS servers to be added, for more privacy.\n\nCompared to AdBlock Plus, this works without proxy stuff; and it also does not\nrequire root, like AdAway does: DNS66 establishes a VPN interface, and redirects\nDNS server traffic to it. The VPN interface filters the traffic, only allowing\nqueries for hosts that are not blacklisted.\n\nA host (list) can be configured as allow, deny, or ignore. A later entry in the\nlist overrides a previous entry.\n\nCustom DNS Servers can be configured as well, using the same UI, but no\ndifferentiation is made between ignored and denied servers.","repo":{"author":"Julian Andres Klode","repo":"https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66"},"version":"afbe1d961688a59b24c9ec55f851647f6cdb71ab2e600f18558db9c281bfb736","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,111,114,103,46,106,97,107,95,108,105,110,117,120,46,100,110,115,54,54,46,50,57,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
