It is also useful with apps that have a user interface for sharing that is more convenient than for saving or copying. For instance, in gallery you easily can use share to sort photos with just 2 taps per photo, whereas using copy would be more cumbersome.\n\n* no root is required\n\n* folders to which you have shared documents at least once are remembered as shortcuts\n\n* for security, sharing to a shortcutted folder is still subject to a confirmation dialog, but you can answer allow always if the target folder is not security critical.\n\n* you can browse your list of recently shared folders in the app’s main activity. Red are those that still require a confirmation to share to, and green are those to which you have answered always. You can remove the pre-authorization again in case you clicked always accidentally or made up your mind.\n\n","repo":{"author":"Alain Knaff","repo":"https://github.com/AlainKnaff/share-to-folder"},"usrVersion":"aa2cc1633972cdd499720e46cd2e4c6e6001ea725d0b28b47a88bb52b081fbcf","version":1769955931,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/AlainKnaff/share-to-folder","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
