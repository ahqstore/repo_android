Currently supports all of the following svn\noperations: Checkout (Head or specify revision), Update, Commit, Export (Head or\nspecify revision), Cleanup, and Revert. Also allows you to view remote\nrepository revisions (you specify the number of revisions to retrieve) and see\ncommit comments, author, date/time and all files changed, added, deleted, etc.\n\nWorking copies and exports of repositories are saved locally (all checked out\nfiles will go to your mountable storage: most of the time /mnt/sdcard/OASVN) so\nthey could be edited on your device with an IDE such as Terminal IDE and then\nyou can commit back to your repository.\n\nThe most recent version adds svn export so you can make a local copy of your\nrepository on your Android device without making a working svn copy.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":""},"version":"1019b56798e99d917a4955251545468d646713ae30dd0d7c904d92fe3826a582","site":null,"source":null,"license_or_tos":"LGPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,99,111,109,46,118,97,108,108,101,121,116,103,46,111,97,115,118,110,46,97,110,100,114,111,105,100,46,49,49,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
