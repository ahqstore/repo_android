We support only this app, not your device's system software. Settings Database Editor (SetEdit) is invaluable if you need it, but if you're not careful you're very likely to mess something up.\n\nBy default, for your protection, Android prevents you from modifying the SECURE and GLOBAL tables. If you have Android Jellybean or later, you can remove this protection from an ADB shell using the command \"pm grant io.github.muntashirakon.setedit android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\". On earlier versions, you can only remove this protection on a rooted device by installing SetEdit to the system partition.\n\nBoth WRITE_SETTINGS and WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permissions are optional if you do not need to edit any items.\n\nThis app needs to target API 22 because API 23 (Android M) onwards do not allow it to modify some setting items without elevated permissions such as root or ADB.\n\nIn Android 14 onwards, a new restriction has been added that prevents an app targeting API 22 or earlier to be installed without elevated permission.\nYou can install the application from an ADB shell using the following command:\n\nadb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk\n\nOr, from a rooted shell:\n\npm install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk\n\n(Replace `SetEdit.apk` with the actual file name or location.)\n","repo":{"author":"Muntashir Al-Islam","repo":"https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/SetEdit"},"version":"4fd5b5c4adaa945ad9c0add75bf261cc06ad94b89971abcc099a974c30f358f6","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/SetEdit","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,111,46,103,105,116,104,117,98,46,109,117,110,116,97,115,104,105,114,97,107,111,110,46,115,101,116,101,100,105,116,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,115,49,104,86,119,80,68,45,108,55,99,85,53,104,95,112,79,121,52,101,70,79,86,109,109,114,68,112,103,122,119,51,111,111,98,73,101,85,57,116,49,71,107,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
