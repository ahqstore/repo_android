There’s a search box and local stations list (based on data from radio-browser.info), favorites and history, and the minimal player UI. That’s it.\n\nDemodulate has a simple yet beautiful user interface based on Material 3. The UI has large elements to make it easy to use on the go or in a car, even in the split-screen mode.\n\nDemodulate can reliably do things many other apps can’t. It will show current track info, play in the background, handle headset buttons, restore playback after a call, and recover from many types of network failures.\n\nDemodulate will cache favorites and history info and switch between available server instances automatically. You can send your playback history if you’d like to make the local station list better for everyone, or if you just want to get updated stream URLs.\n","repo":{"author":"Mateusz Nowak","repo":"https://gitlab.com/mateusznowakdev/demodulate"},"usrVersion":"e8154b6a60a180b5fbf809d91c72284019f286031c4d478dedcf257c9b37b9d7","version":1760308749,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/mateusznowakdev/demodulate","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
