That's it.\n\nDemodulate can also reliably do things other apps can't. It will show current track info, play in the background, handle headset buttons, restore playback after a call, and recover from many types of network failures.\n\nDemodulate has a simple yet beautiful user interface based on Material 3. The UI has large elements to make it easy to use on the go or in a car, even in the split-screen mode.\n\nDemodulate will cache favorites and history info and switch between available server instances automatically. You can send your playback history if you'd like to make the local station list better for everyone.\n","repo":{"author":"Mateusz Nowak","repo":"https://gitlab.com/mateusznowakdev/demodulate"},"usrVersion":"a4f9740a601fb1407c22e155ca9335bd88318b9cf01bb74e31e37779c6aea882","version":1759703908,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/mateusznowakdev/demodulate","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
