It has a very rich command set, though it is still easy to learn.\nThe syntax is most similar to GFA-Basic for ATARI-ST. It is a structured dialect\nwith no line numbers. A full manual and command reference is available.\nGFA-programs should run with only a few changes. Also DOS/QBASIC programmers\nwill feel comfortable. This implementation is one of the fastest basic\ninterpreters for Android. Programs can be compiled into a platform independant\nbytecode.\n","repo":{"author":"Markus Hoffmann","repo":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/X11-Basic"},"version":"a9653150b77cee26e658adb6ede3bd3b8070c6ce26969f05592a12ff3586273d","site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/kollo/X11-Basic","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,110,101,116,46,115,111,117,114,99,101,102,111,114,103,101,46,120,49,49,98,97,115,105,99,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,98,118,113,85,108,97,69,76,119,69,83,81,115,49,99,89,107,79,65,106,97,45,77,98,52,76,112,119,115,103,101,112,76,50,84,80,50,70,72,105,108,67,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
