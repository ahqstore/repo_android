It was originally\ndeveloped by Codebrew Software in 2004 for the J2ME platform.\n\nCodebrew launched an Android version of the game in 2012, though it was totally\nremade. This game is a port to Android, trying to change as little as possible\nfrom the original.\n\nThis port includes all features of the original Gravity Defied. In addition,\nmore than 1000 levels mods made by fans since 2007 have been collected. You can\ninstall any mod and switch between mods directly from the game menu.","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/gch1p/gravitydefied"},"usrVersion":"b1c98167a6f35476bc4b52fe2063f60c012076ed52382938ed417c21643677b5","version":1759927111,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/gch1p/gravitydefied","license_or_tos":"GPL-2.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
