There is an accompanying app which can be used to\nconfigure what area you want and shows the raw feed data if you're really\ncurious (though that part was mostly there for debugging, and might go away one\nof these days now that it all works). It does not currently do audible alerts\n(or any alerts), but that's probably coming soon.","repo":{"author":"Dave Miller","repo":"https://github.com/justdave/nwsweatheralertswidget"},"version":"6c224103eea6175edd02bdf5edcace95bc1a3ac3e79d3b6f26cfff98bfd88418","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/justdave/nwsweatheralertswidget","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,105,99,111,110,115,47,110,101,116,46,106,117,115,116,100,97,118,101,46,110,119,115,119,101,97,116,104,101,114,97,108,101,114,116,115,119,105,100,103,101,116,46,49,50,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
