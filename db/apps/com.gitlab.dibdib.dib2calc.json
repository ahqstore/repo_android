Once you get used to it, you will love it :-)\nDib2Calc (aka Dibdib Calculator)\n\nThe crazy calculator. A short introduction is provided when you start it for\nthe first time.\n\nThe goal is to provide many specific functions, especially for text data and\ndata structures, not only for calculating numbers. This is one of the reasons\nwhy it makes use of the so-called RPN notation: instead of typing 4 '+' 3 '=',\nyou type 4, 3, '+' (but you can also type 4 5 6, 3, '+' resulting in 7 8 9,\nbecause 7=4+3, 8=5+3, 9=6+3 ...)\n\nJust try it out. Once you get used to it, you will love it :-)\n\nYour data is protected (encrypted) if you use your own access code and\npassword. In case you have a lot of data, make sure to save it to the device's\nDownload area via the SAVTO function (as a backup).\n\nSee https://gitlab.com/dibdib/dib2calc for more information (and\nhttps://gitlab.com/dibdib/dib2calc/-/blob/master/known_issues.md for\nknown issues).\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://gitlab.com/dibdib/dib2calc/tree/HEAD"},"usrVersion":"542cf159294afb871641838a25caae76cb026071eb310ac9456687d738992432","version":1765770080,"site":null,"source":"https://gitlab.com/dibdib/dib2calc/tree/HEAD","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
