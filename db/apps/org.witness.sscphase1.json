With ObscuraCam you can blur and disguise faces in your photos and videos. Information that could identify you as the cameraperson is removed from the files for added security\n\n* PRIVACY FOR YOUR PICTURES: ObscuraCam can be used as a camera to take photos, or to anonymize photos and videos you’ve already taken\n* DISGUISE YOURSELF: Cover faces with pixelate, redact (blackout) or funny nose and glasses\n* AUTOMATIC FACE DETECTION: ObscuraCam automatically detects faces in both photos and videos, so you can quickly and easily anonymize a crowd or a long video\n* MULTIPLE PRIVACY MODES: Faces can be pixelated, removed completely, or disguised with funny nose and glasses. You can also blur everything except a small portion of an image\n* SHARE SECURELY: We remove all identifying data stored in photos including GPS location data and phone make & model so you can save the protected photo back to the Gallery, or share it directly to Facebook, Twitter or any other \"Share\" enabled app\n* PROTECTS THE IDENTITY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHER: Smartphones attach information to every photo they take, including where it was taken and by what type of camera.
