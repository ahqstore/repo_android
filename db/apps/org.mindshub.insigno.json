It is a project developed by the MindsHub Association: https://mindshub.it/.\n\nAny user can <b>report</b> abandoned garbage they find, <i>classifying</i> it by type (plastic, paper, ...) and taking a <i>picture</i> to make it simple to locate the object. All reports then appear on a <b>map</b>, allowing users to <b>pick up</b> nearby garbage, taking pictures to document the process. Reporting and collecting trash allow users to <b>earn points</b>, and require access to the phone's <i>location</i> in order to determine the object's position.\n\nInformative <i><b>pills</b></i> will be shown each time the app is launched, with FAQs, news, and tips regarding ecology and environment protection.\n\nInsigno is completely <b>Free Software</b>, you can find the code here:\n- Frontend (app): https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_frontend\n- Backend (server): https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_backend","repo":{"author":"MindsHub","repo":"https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_frontend"},"version":"6e73b322675545ec378b4d3b55288f528fabc46b59a4ee5bd0ec07f7d724ed58","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/MindsHub/insigno_frontend","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
