It focuses on privacy, longevity, and user control. Logseq offers a range of powerful tools for knowledge management, collaboration, PDF annotation, and task management with support for multiple file formats, including Markdown and Org-mode, and various features for organizing and structuring your notes.\n\nLogseq's Whiteboard feature lets you organize your knowledge and ideas using a spatial canvas with shapes, drawings, website embeds, and connectors.

Mobile apps are also available, providing access to most of the features of the desktop application. Whether you're a student, a professional, or anyone who values a clear and organized approach to managing your ideas and notes, Logseq is an excellent choice for anyone looking to improve their productivity and streamline their workflow.\n","repo":{"author":"Logseq dev team","repo":"https://github.com/logseq/logseq"},"usrVersion":"4e84ea096030917ffc34b30aa3de8acb8ad785222f460533a4427526d913487e","version":1760899505,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/logseq/logseq","license_or_tos":"AGPL-3.0-only","resources":null,"verified":false}
