Cash or online. Safe, fast, easy.\nBuy or sell Monero without ID verification. Cash or online. Safe, fast, easy.\n\nLocalMonero is the biggest, most trusted and well-established P2P trading platform in the XMR community. We have no KYC checks - you can simply buy Monero anonymously without ID verification with PayPal, credit card, gift card, cash by mail or convert Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, or any other crypto coin to Monero - our platform supports any payment method.\n\n- Safe and Smooth Trading\nWe support any payment method, any currency, anywhere. We do not remove payment methods, and we fully support face-to-face cash trades. All of our trades are protected by an arbitration bond. Thanks to the fact that we require funds to be held in arbitration bond before a trade can start, we ensure a smooth and safe experience for the buyer, which is essential for the popularity of the platform and repeat customers for the sellers.\n\n- No KYC/AML or ID Verification\nLocalMonero is committed to maintaining the simplicity and straight-forwardness of your trading experience. We do not employ KYC/AML, nor do we ever plan on doing so.\n\n- Trusted by the Community\nOur platform has operated for over four years, survived the Great Cryptocurrency Market Crash of 2018, and through its community-oriented diligent service became one of the most trusted names in the extremely skeptical Monero community.\n\n- Secure, Open Source, Privacy-Centric, Censorship-Resistant\nOur app is free and open source, which ensures that many eyes are looking at the app's code to ensure that there are no security holes or privacy leaks. Open sourcing our app also allows anyone to have access to our app even if a certain app repository censors the app. Our app even works on phones that have Google completely blocked. We value your privacy so much, we don’t even require you to provide an email when registering.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss\nIssue tracker: https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss/issues\n\n- Stellar Support\nOur support team is fast, responsive and always eager to please. We’ve never had a support ticket that wasn’t answered within 24 hours. We are always easily reachable through social media, we listen intently to your criticisms and we always implement good user suggestions in record time.\n\nYou can reach our support at: https://localmonero.co/support\n\n- Fair Fees\nWe do not charge exorbitant fees when you deposit or withdraw Monero to/from our arbitration bond wallet. There is no deposit fee, and the withdrawal fee is very close to the fee you’d be paying on a normal transaction.","repo":{"author":"AgoraDesk","repo":"https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss"},"version":"9b4e727e5756e9674da4428046fe6aff6bbff77056010e5572aa1efbfe9789bd","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/AgoraDesk-LocalMonero/agoradesk-app-foss","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
