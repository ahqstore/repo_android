This can quickly result in costly roaming fees.</p>\n<p>Manually toggling roaming is inconvenient and easy to forget.<br/><b>Roaming Borders</b> automates the guardrails so you don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p><b>What it does</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Block roaming when you don’t want it:</b> Select allowed countries; if your device connects outside that list, data traffic is blocked.</li>\n  <li><b>Avoid surprise charges:</b> Prevent accidental cross-border roaming near national frontiers.</li>\n  <li><b>Simple presets or full control:</b> Choose ready-made country presets or build your own list for upcoming trips.</li>\n  <li><b>On-device only:</b> Uses Android’s <i>VpnService</i> as a local firewall. No tunneling to servers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>How it works</b></p>\n<p>Roaming Borders runs a lightweight, on-device VPN that filters traffic based on your current country.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When your current country <b>is not</b> in your allow-list → <b>block</b> data traffic system-wide.</li>\n  <li>When your current country <b>is</b> allowed → <b>allow</b> traffic as normal.</li>\n  <li>When connected to <b>Wi-Fi</b>, the guard <b>pauses automatically</b> and <b>resumes</b> once Wi-Fi disconnects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Note on reboot:</b> After restarting your phone, the guard re-enables after a short delay. To be extra safe, enable <i>Airplane mode</i> before restarting.</p>\n","repo":{"author":"Simon Leistikow","repo":"https://github.com/sleistikow/RoamingBorders"},"usrVersion":"e45331b0b04e0c9712d52f8de85441b976c57443761baf1f6a0d81a751a8e720","version":1763040760,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/sleistikow/RoamingBorders","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
