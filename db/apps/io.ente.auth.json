It provides secure, end-to-end encrypted backup to your codes, works across devices whether its Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux or Web. It also offers quality of life features like Tap to Copy, Next Code, and even allows you to share your codes securely with others. \n\nOur customers absolutely love it.\n\n- It works everywhere and can either be used in the cloud with end-to-end encryption or on a single device without the need for an account. Ente’s UI is well thought out and easy to use. Plus it even shows you the next code if the current one is about to expire so you dont have to wait for it to roll over before your start typing. You can even pin, tag, and search your codes which makes it a lot easier to manage a big list compared to Google Authenticator. They call it a labour of love on their Github page, and it really looks like one. - Linus Tech Tips\n\n- Underrated but great authenticator app. Free, open source, and offers cloud backup. Very stable, has nice QoL features like the preview for the next code and the search bar. Overall, the best 2FA app I've used yet. - Luna Lometta\n\n- Fantastic, fluid, has a dark theme, is open source, and also has a PC program. I switched from Authy to Ente Auth precisely for this reason, and I was surprised since the app as a whole is better and faster. - Daniel Ramos\n\n- Better than Google Authenticator. - Piaw Piaw Kittens\n\n- Authy's best replacement. Open source, desktop support, synchronization, convenient token export. Huge thanks to the developers, I hope your product will become popular and famous. - Sergey Tverye\n\n- By far my favourite 2FA app. Over the years I've moved from Google Authenticator to Authy and have now happily \"settled\" with Ente Auth. - Dan Walsh\n\n- The best MFA app I ever used. I will never go back to Google Authenticator. - Pierre-Philippe Lessard\n\nEnte Auth is recommended by Linus Tech Tips, CERN, Zerodha and many others.\n\n✨ Features\n\nEASY IMPORT\nAdd TOTP 2FA Codes to Ente Auth easily.
