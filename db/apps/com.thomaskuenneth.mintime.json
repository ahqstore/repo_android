It divides the talk time into three phases: green, yellow and red. With a glimpse you get an idea how much time is left.\n\nFor example, a 70 minutes talk could be divided into 50, 15 and 5 minute segments. Once started, Min Time counts down from 70 to 0, changing colors and vibrating when a new phase is reached. During presentation you can switch to other apps. The app is intentionally kept simple. Just a few taps and you are ready to give your talk. To finish your presentations and tasks just in time.\n","repo":{"author":"Thomas Künneth","repo":"https://codeberg.org/tkuenneth/mintime"},"usrVersion":"2a33c1abb6cbd98c9afc7143254d3a8b13060a68db4a0e50ff5533e7c4110e7f","version":1769258374,"site":null,"source":"https://codeberg.org/tkuenneth/mintime","license_or_tos":"MIT","resources":null,"verified":false}
