Find out if a year is a leap year, calculate the number of days, business days, weeks, weekends, month turns and years between two dates? Want to add or subtract days, weeks or months to a given date?\n\nWith TKWeek, it‘s no hassle. Even a basic calendar view is at your fingertips. You can use it to flag days off. Just tap and hold until the color changes. And with My Day you see what is up on a particular day.\n\nCurious to know when Friday 13th takes place? TKWeek will tell you.
