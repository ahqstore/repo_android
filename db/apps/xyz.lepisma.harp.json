You can add journal entries but other\nfeatures will come in later releases. The core structure of the Org Mode file is\nnearly set (documentation pending) and you can, of course, work on those files\nfrom Emacs on your desktop without relying on Harp.\n","repo":{"author":"Abhinav Tushar","repo":"https://git.sr.ht/~lepisma/harp-kmp"},"usrVersion":"49d6d4b92386d7eb89fada4ce5347b24079fb84ecc37435ba8b8cef1a1fde5dc","version":1764651101,"site":null,"source":"https://git.sr.ht/~lepisma/harp-kmp","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
