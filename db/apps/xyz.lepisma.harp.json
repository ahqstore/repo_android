You can add journal entries but other features will come in later releases. The core structure of the Org Mode file can be seen on the app website. Based on that you can work on harp records from Emacs on your desktop by just syncing the backing Org mode files.\n","repo":{"author":"Abhinav Tushar","repo":"https://git.sr.ht/~lepisma/harp-kmp"},"usrVersion":"de0b0ad5ba40ab729c404e7128b6bfdfd15bf6c6890717e49c1cf7c72ef90202","version":1767048259,"site":null,"source":"https://git.sr.ht/~lepisma/harp-kmp","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
