Instant video conferences, efficiently adapting to your scale.\n\n* Unlimited users: There are no artificial restrictions on the number of users or conference participants.

And your friends at 8x8.\n* Invite by pretty URLs: You can meet at the easy to remember https://MySite.com/OurConf of your choice instead of joining the hard to remember rooms with seemingly random sequences of numbers and letters in their names.","repo":{"author":"The Jitsi Team at 8x8 and contributors","repo":"https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet"},"version":"673ef46062a3dba0003c33992bd272666788d9c4ac22a5d6643a92bc8cf6a93d","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
