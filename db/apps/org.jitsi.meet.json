And your friends at 8x8.\n* Invite by pretty URLs: You can meet at the easy to remember https://MySite.com/OurConf of your choice instead of joining the hard to remember rooms with seemingly random sequences of numbers and letters in their names.","repo":{"author":"The Jitsi Team at 8x8 and contributors","repo":"https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet"},"usrVersion":"0f4697e4181e32b3fe252b27a8d50c1f575c5125279e5437f3c93c88ba6508ea","version":1762152859,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet","license_or_tos":"Apache-2.0","resources":null,"verified":false}
