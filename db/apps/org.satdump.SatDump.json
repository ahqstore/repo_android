This includes many weather, science, and other generic missions. If you also happen to be in range of a geostationnary satellite such as GOES, GK-2A or similar you will also be able to do all processing directly on your Android device.  \n\nEspecially on a phone, a good usecase is receiving 137Mhz weather satellites on the go.\n\nSupported SDRs :\n- RTL-SDR\n- Airspy\n- Airspy HF\n- MiriSDR\n- LimeSDR Mini\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/satdump/satdump"},"usrVersion":"a0f7c1c900564d7c7bbeb82647a9428c879944c815e39ede1cc514c6fc8c3a1e","version":1760424620,"site":null,"source":"https://github.com/satdump/satdump","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":null,"verified":false}
