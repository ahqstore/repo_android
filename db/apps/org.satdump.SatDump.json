This includes many weather, science, and other generic missions. If you also happen to be in range of a geostationnary satellite such as GOES, GK-2A or similar you will also be able to do all processing directly on your Android device.  \n\nEspecially on a phone, a good usecase is receiving 137Mhz weather satellites on the go.\n\nSupported SDRs :\n- RTL-SDR\n- Airspy\n- Airspy HF\n- MiriSDR\n- LimeSDR Mini\n","repo":{"author":"Unknown","repo":"https://github.com/satdump/satdump"},"version":"a0f7c1c900564d7c7bbeb82647a9428c879944c815e39ede1cc514c6fc8c3a1e","site":null,"source":"https://github.com/satdump/satdump","license_or_tos":"GPL-3.0-or-later","resources":{"0":[104,116,116,112,115,58,47,47,102,45,100,114,111,105,100,46,111,114,103,47,114,101,112,111,47,111,114,103,46,115,97,116,100,117,109,112,46,83,97,116,68,117,109,112,47,101,110,45,85,83,47,105,99,111,110,95,119,82,120,97,109,48,104,120,118,85,55,95,84,55,90,85,52,87,87,89,50,79,75,99,69,51,72,95,72,66,83,80,89,49,84,67,89,112,78,122,121,99,111,61,46,112,110,103]},"verified":false}
